a text-message scam that infects android phones is spreading across the uk, experts have warned. the message - which pretends to be from a package delivery firm, prompts users to install a tracking app - but is actually a malicious piece of spyware. called flubot, it can take over devices and spy on phones to gather sensitive data, including online banking details. network operator vodafone said millions of the text messages were already being sent, across all networks. "we believe this current wave of flubot malware sms attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread," a spokesman said.  customers should "be especially vigilant with this particular piece of malware", he said, and be very careful about clicking on any links in a text message.  other networks, including ee and three, followed with warnings of their own. the national cyber security centre (ncsc) later issued guidance about the threat, including advice on what to do if you have already downloaded the attacker's application by mistake. "if users have clicked a malicious link it's important not to panic - there are actionable steps they can take to protect their devices and their accounts," the ncsc said in a statement. the malware also has the ability to send more text messages to an infected user's contacts, helping it spread.  "the seriousness of these malicious text messages is underlined by vodafone making the decision to alert its customers," said ben wood, chief analyst at ccs insight. "this has the potential to become a denial-of-service attack on mobile networks, given the clear risk that a rogue application can be installed on users' smartphones and start spewing out endless text messages.  "the broader risk for users is a loss of highly sensitive personal data from their phones," he added. fresh warnings over royal mail parcel scamex-police officer 'devastated' by £3k text scamfake nhs vaccine messages sent in banking scam while text message scams claiming to be about a package delivery firm are common, they have mostly focused on phishing - trying to trick the user into filling in a form with bank details and other information. this newest wave differs because it tries to install malicious software on the phone itself - and because of the scale of its spread.  one version of the scam reported online pretends to be a text message from dhl, with a link to a website for parcel tracking. if someone using an android phone clicks on the link, they will be taken to a page "explaining" how to install the parcel tracking app using something called an apk. apk files are a way of installing android apps outside of the secure google play store. by default, such applications will be blocked for security reasons, but the scam page includes instructions on how to allow the installation. that can be confusing, as there are some niche genuine cases for installing those kind of apps - such as downloading the fortnite video game, which was removed from the official app store amid a major legal row between its owner and google.  apple iphone users are not affected as those phones cannot install android apks. in a blog post detailing the scam, security researcher paul morrison wrote that he expects the "success rate would be low" due to the hurdles involved. but he said: "with the number of sms being sent out, just a 0.1% success rate could be very profitable." the flubot malware has also spread in other countries in recent months - notably spain, germany and poland. kate bevan, computing editor at consumer magazine which? said people have to be "wary" of texts.  "if you're not sure, contact the delivery company's official customer service helpline," she said. "as ever, it's important to make sure that your mobile phone is up to date with security patches. consider also installing mobile security software from a trusted brand." industry body mobile uk said users who receive a suspicious message should forward it to 7726 to report it, a spokesman said - and then delete the message. about 30,000 mac devices have been infected with a mysterious piece of malware. the "unusual" silver sparrow strain silently affected systems in more than 150 countries around the world.  it was discovered by researchers at security company red canary, who have yet to determine its purpose. apple says it has taken steps to restrict the potential damage the malware, which targets devices with its new m1 chip, could cause.  its actions effectively prevent any new devices from being infected. al jazeera staff ‘hacked via israeli spyware’apple's security chief charged with bribery bbc news has asked apple to clarify how existing users can tell if they are affected.  researchers said silver sparrow "did not exhibit the behaviours that we’ve come to expect from the usual adware that so often targets macos systems". it appears to call a command-and-control server every hour, from an infected machine, to check for "further instructions".  it also has a system in place to self-destruct and hide its existence entirely.   "though we haven’t observed silver sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its global reach, relatively high infection rate, and operational maturity suggest silver sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice,” the researchers said.  lisa forte, from red goat cyber security, told bbc news the attack should be a wake-up call to mac users who assumed they were not at the same risk as windows users of being infected by malware.  "the malware doesn’t appear to have done anything nasty," she said. "but the fact it spread so fast and infected so many devices is alarming in itself.  "no device is immune from viruses." computer security expert alan woodward said the attack appeared to be an effort to disprove this long-standing myth.  "it is as if someone was trying a proof of concept of how to move harmful code on to macs and to control it once there," he said. "but they didn’t include the truly damaging elements." some of the laptops given out in england to support vulnerable children home-schooling during lockdown contain malware, bbc news has learned. teachers shared details on an online forum about suspicious files found on devices sent to a bradford school. the malware, which they said appeared to be contacting russian servers, is believed to have been found on laptops given to a handful of schools. the department for education said it was aware and urgently investigating. can you get a free laptop or cheap broadband?covid 19: the huge challenges of home-schooling a dfe official told bbc news: "we are aware of an issue with a small number of devices. and we are investigating as an urgent priority to resolve the matter as soon as possible. "dfe it teams are in touch with those who have reported this issue." "we believe this is not widespread." geo, the firm which made the laptops, told the bbc: "we have been working closely with the department for education regarding a reported issue on a very small number of devices. we are providing our full support during their investigation.  "we take all matters of security extremely seriously. any schools that have concerns should contact the department for education." according to the forum, the windows laptops contained gamarue.i, a worm identified by microsoft in 2012.  the government has so far sent schools more than 800,000 laptops, as it tries to distribute more than a million devices to disadvantaged pupils who may not have access at home.  "upon unboxing and preparing them, it was discovered that a number of the laptops were infected with a self-propagating network worm," wrote marium haque, deputy director of education and learning at bradford council. she recommended that schools also check their networks "as an added precaution". information security consultant paul moore told the bbc that the gamarue worm "presents a very severe threat to any pc or network". "ideally users should reboot into safe mode and run a full scan with an anti-virus product," he said. "however with this type of malware, it is advisable to seek professional assistance in order to ensure it has been correctly removed." the malware in question installs spyware which can gather information about browsing habits, as well as harvest personal information such as banking details. "the fact that these devices were not checked and scrubbed before being sent to vulnerable children is a concern," said george glass, head of threat intelligence at security firm redscan. subway customers in the uk are receiving scam emails as part of a phishing attack. users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware. the emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's subcard loyalty scheme. subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is. but the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem. a spokesperson for the company said: "we are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email." it apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email. the problem was earlier reported by computer security news site bleeping computer, which said it had found a form of malware called trickbot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click. trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware. the email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam. bleeping computer reports that these documents include an excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus. it is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers. online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses. update 12 december: subway has issued a fresh statement: "having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. however, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email. the system does not hold any bank or credit card details. crisis protocol was initiated and compromised systems locked down. the safety of our guests and their personal data is our overriding priority and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused." computing giant microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the uk, us, germany, japan and china has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.  yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. however, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting microsoft's widely-used exchange email system. and the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. so is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more pcs, or should businesses be more worried? firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a pc.  increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the pc to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. this is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. microsoft hack: 3,000 uk email servers unsecuredhundreds of uk firms hacked in global cyber-crisiscyber-flaw affects 745,000 pacemakers security experts have told the bbc that even if it departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. "people don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things," explains australian cyber-security researcher robert potter.  mr potter built the washington post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the australian government on cyber-security. "firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot." there have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as robbinhood, a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a bitcoin ransom has been paid. this malware held the data of several us city governments hostage in may 2019.  another example is thunderspy, an attack that utilises the direct memory access (dma) function that pc hardware components use to talk to each other. this attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. "if device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible," explains chris boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm malwarebytes.   "remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more." the good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to gabriel cirlig, a security researcher with us cyber-security firm human (formerly white ops). "it is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware," he tells the bbc. typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.  firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.  the national institute of standards and technology (nist), an agency within the us department of commerce, continually updates a national vulnerability database (nvd) with new security flaws. the database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.  carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says mr cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.  nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. "this is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do." although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the bbc spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security. "firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack," says mr boyd.  "it's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected." mr boyd adds that a new generation of "budding hardware enthusiasts" who have been learning their way around firmware by "modding video game consoles over the last decade" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point mt cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.  "microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies," says mr potter.  "as we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. and if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it." malware which signed users up to subscription services without their permission has been found on thousands of mobiles sold in africa. anti-fraud firm upstream found the malicious code on 53,000 tecno handsets, sold in ethiopia, cameroon, egypt, ghana and south africa. manufacturer transsion told buzzfeed it was installed in the supply chain without its knowledge. upstream said it was taking advantage of the "most vulnerable". "the fact that the malware arrives pre-installed on handsets that are bought in their millions by typically low-income households tells you everything you need to know about what the industry is currently up against," said geoffrey cleaves, head of upstream's secure-d platform. the triada malware found by the firm on the android smartphones installs malicious code known as xhelper which then finds subscription services and submits fraudulent requests on behalf of users, doing so invisibly and without the user's knowledge. if the request is successful, it consumes pre-paid airtime, the only way to pay for digital services in many developing countries. in total, upstream found what it described as "suspicious activity" on more than 200,000 tecno smartphones. according to research firm idc, transsion holdings is one of china's leading phone manufacturers and in africa it is the top-selling mobile manufacturer. in response tecno mobile said that the issue was "an old and solved mobile security issue globally" to which it issued a fix in march 2018. "for current w2 consumers that are potentially facing triada issues now, they are highly recommended to download the over-the-air fix through their phone for installation or contact tecno's after-sales service support for assistance in any questions," the firm told the bbc in a statement. it added that it is attached "great importance to consumers' data security and product safety". "every single software installed on each device runs through a series of rigorous security checks, such as our own security scan platform," it added. at the beginning of the year, security firm malwarebytes warned that similar pre-installed apps were found on another chinese android phone - the umx u686cl. this handset was offered to low-income families in the us via a government scheme. and in 2016, researcher ryan johnson found that more than 700 million android smartphones had malware installed. google, which developed the android operating system, is aware of the issue. in a blog written last year it blamed third-party vendors, used by manufacturers to install features such as face unlock, for pre-installing triada malware. it said it had worked with manufacturers to remove the threat from devices. mobile phones offered to low-income families via a us government scheme come preloaded with chinese malware, according to a security company. malwarebytes said it had received several complaints that pre-installed apps on the phone were malicious. it had bought one to verify the claims and informed the company selling them, assurance wireless, of its findings but had not received a response, it said. the android-based phone - umx u686cl - is made by a chinese company. bbc news has contacted virgin mobile - which owns assurance wireless - for comment but has not yet received a response. one of the pre-installed apps, which looks and operates as a wireless update program, automatically installs more apps without user consent, according to malwarebytes. and it appears to be a variant of adups, malware previously traced to china, which transmits text, call-location and app data to a chinese server every 72 hours. in 2016, researcher ryan johnson, of security company kryptowire, found more than 700 million android smartphones, including some in the us, had adups installed. his report prompted investigations from google and the department of homeland security. a second app containing malware, on the umx u686cl phone, used code containing chinese characters, malwarebytes said. and neither of the apps were removable. "that there's a mobile device available for purchase through a us government-funded programme raises the bar on bad behaviour by app-development companies," said malwarebytes security consultant nathan collier in a blogpost. "it's important to realise that umx isn't alone.  "there are many reports of budget phones coming pre-installed with malware and these reports are increasing in number.  "although i don't have the answer to this widespread issue, i can say that us citizens using the lifeline assistance program and many others on a tight budget deserve more." the lifeline programme has been offered to low-income americans since 1985.  typically, users pay about $10 (£8) a month for a 3g phone with between 500mb and 1gb of data. the scheme is run by the federal communications commission, which has not responded to requests from bbc news for comment. google is beefing up the way it checks if any of the apps uploaded to its play store are malicious. all new apps will be scanned by malware-spotting tools from three cyber-security companies as well as google's own in-house system. google said it needed help because the number of apps being uploaded was too large for it to handle alone. nasty play apps can hit lots of people. malicious code found in june was in apps downloaded 400 million times. security companies zimperium, eset and lookout will work together on what google has called the app defense alliance. the four partners will set up a combined scanning system that will scrutinise apps as they pass through google's pipeline on the way to being offered to android users via the play store. working from massive databases of known malware, behavioural clues and machine-learning models of novel threats the scanners will look for trojans, adware, ransomware, banking malware and phishing attacks. "on the malware side, we haven't really had a way to scale as much as we've wanted to scale," dave kleidermacher, google's vice-president of android security, told wired magazine. mr kleidermacher added there were so many apps being developed, even making a "1% incremental improvement" could make a difference.  the scanning system is the latest in a series of steps google has taken in its bid to do a better job of policing the play store.  in april, it announced more rigorous checks for developers to root out "bad faith" coders who produced and uploaded malicious or fraudulent apps. a hugely popular android app that takes high quality photographs of documents has been found to contain malware. camscanner has been downloaded more than 100 million times by android users. however, cyber-security researchers at kaspersky say they found that a recent version contained malicious code in the part of the app that delivers ads. the malware could have made it possible to show users intrusive ads or snoop on login credentials. kaspersky's researchers noted that camscanner was a "legitimate" app, but think that the snippet of malicious code found in it was third-party code used to serve ads within apps. a spokeswoman for kaspersky told the bbc that researchers did not examine the iphone version of camscanner to see if it was also affected.  the free version of camscanner for android is currently not available on google's play store in the uk. camscanner said it had released a new version of the app, with the malicious code removed. android ditches desserts as q becomes 10google play app store accused of anti-gay bias if you have automatic updates enabled for your apps, which many people do, there is a chance you have a version of camscanner containing malware on your device. if in doubt, it is best to delete camscanner and wait for a new version to be launched and tested by cyber-security researchers, said matthew hickey at security firm hacker house. users may also use an anti-virus app to check for any malicious software that might have been installed. "it is said the average consumer has around 40 applications on their phone they will use frequently, so ensure you regularly review any of those applications that you are not using," he told the bbc. mr hickey also advised users who have mobile banking apps to be particularly cautious and use an anti-virus app that can regularly check for malicious code. this was important because there had been a "sharp increase" recently in discoveries of malware infecting apps on the google play app store, he added.  a laptop packed with six types of dangerous malware has been sold for $1.3m (£1.03m) in an online auction. the artwork titled the persistence of chaos was a joint project between artist guo o dong and cyber-security company deep instinct. an anonymous bidder bought the 11-year-old samsung notebook containing the malware. under the terms of the auction, the buyer has 24 hours to provide follow-up information regarding payment. among the malware loaded on the pc was the infamous iloveyou virus from 2000, which infected computers at the houses of parliament, as well as other institutions. also included was the wannacry ransomware that struck organisations around the world in 2017. the nhs faced £92m in costs after wannacry spread through its systems. "malware is one of the most tangible ways that the internet can jump out of your monitor and bite you," guo o dong told tech news site motherboard. because the sale of malware is restricted in the us, whoever purchases the laptop will receive it only once its ports and internet capabilities have been "functionally disabled", according to the auction web page. the british computer hacker who helped stop a major cyber-attack affecting the nhs in 2017 has avoided a jail sentence in the us over malicious hacking charges. in april, 25-year-old marcus hutchins pleaded guilty to two charges of making malicious software, or malware. prosecutors alleged that the malware let cyber-criminals steal online banking details from internet users. hutchins admitted to creating two programs known as kronos and upas kit. since hutchins' arrest in 2017, he has remained in the us on bail.  the judge presiding at hutchins' hearing, jp stadtmueller, said that the 25-year-old would face one year of supervised release. however, he would be allowed to return to the uk and would not have to pay any fines. hutchins had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. british hacker loses bid to omit evidencearrested cyber-expert 'had used drugs' in court documents filed earlier this year, investigators acknowledged that hutchins, known online as malwaretech, was no longer involved in creating malware. he created kronos and upas kit between 2012 and 2015 but later switched towards ethical hacking and cyber-security research. us prosecutors argued hutchins still bore responsibility for his actions. this did not seem to sway the judge who praised hutchins for "turning a corner" during sentencing at the court in milwaukee, wisconsin. hutchins, from ilfracombe in devon, was credited with discovering a "kill switch" for the wannacry ransomware, which hit the nhs and many other organisations around the world in may 2017. three months later, he was arrested by the fbi before boarding a flight from las vegas to the uk. he had been attending the def con cyber-security conference in the city. on the day before his sentencing, hutchins tweeted a message of thanks to supporters who had sent character reference letters to the court on his behalf. "it means so much!" he wrote. previously, in a statement published on his website in april, hutchins said he wrote the malware before he began his career in cyber-security. "i regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes," he said. "having grown up, i've since been using the same skills that i misused several years ago for constructive purposes. i will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks." police have warned students in the uk against using a website that they say lets users "illegally access" millions of scientific research papers. the city of london police's intellectual property crime unit says using the sci-hub website could "pose a threat" to students' personal data. the police are concerned that users of the "russia-based website" could have information taken and misused online. the sci-hub website says it "removes all barriers" to science. it offers open access to more than 85 million scientific papers and claims that copyright laws should be abolished and that such material should be "knowledge to all". it describes itself as "the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers". but max bruce, the city of london police's cyber protection officer, has urged universities to block the website on their networks because of the "threat posed by sci-hub to both the university and its students". "if you're tricked into revealing your log-in credentials, whether it's through the use of fake emails or malware, we know that sci-hub will then use those details to compromise your university's computer network in order to steal research papers," he said. the city of london police, which is the national lead for fraud, has warned that students studying online at home might be vulnerable. "students should be aware that accessing such websites is illegal, as it hosts stolen intellectual property," said det insp kevin ives. he warned that visitors to the website, whose twitter account has been suspended, are "very vulnerable to having their credentials stolen". the police warning says scientific papers could have been obtained by a "variety of malicious means, such as the use of phishing emails to trick university staff and students into divulging their login credentials". but the sci-hub website has previously told the bbc that it provides students with access to research papers for which the subscriptions are "very expensive". andrew pitts, chief executive of the psi registry, which highlights "academic piracy", has warned that users "may inadvertently download potentially dangerous content from this illegal site and put the security of their organisations at risk". the national cyber security centre, part of the gchq intelligence service, has warned of the threat of cyber-attacks against universities. last autumn the cyber-agency warned of online attacks attempting to "derail" the start of the academic year in universities. a laptop deliberately infected with six notorious strains of malware, including wannacry and iloveyou, is being auctioned in the us as an art project. at time of writing, the highest bid for the device was $1.1m (£800,000). the auction states that the samsung laptop's internet connectivity will be disabled when the device is shipped to the auction winner.  the 11-year-old notebook has been air-gapped - a security measure to isolate it from other networks. it is illegal in the us to sell malware for the purpose of causing damage.  the terms and conditions of the auction state that the laptop must be purchased "as a piece of art or for academic reasons". the auction ends on wednesday. the project is a collaboration between the artist guo o dong and a new york cyber-security company called deep instinct. "we came to understand this project as a kind of bestiary, a catalogue of historical threats," guo told vice.  "it's more exciting to see the beasts in a live environment." the six strains of malware on the laptop are: wannacry - the ransomware that hit the nhs in 2017iloveyou - released in the year 2000, this infected 50 million computers in two weeks, including at the cia, pentagon and uk parliamentmydoom - a rapid-spreading 2004 windows email worm that looked like an error messagesobig - when this was discovered, in 2003, one security company told bbc news one in 17 emails it was seeing was carrying the virusdarktequila - a keylogger malware designed to steal financial data and log-in credentialsblackenergy - used to attack ukraine's power grid in 2016 the auction has bemused some cyber-security experts. "if you want to save a million dollars, you could connect a laptop to the internet without antivirus software and security patches and leave it a few days for a similar infestation," said kevin beaumont. nurseries and childminders are being warned of the threat of cyber-attacks, in guidance from the government's national cyber security centre (ncsc). it is the first time that the agency - part of the gchq intelligence service - has given guidance to a sector caring for such young children. it includes warnings to use password protection for information for parents. "we know that incidents affecting the education sector are increasingly common," said sarah lyons at the ncsc. the cyber-agency says pre-school providers and childminders are "increasingly relying on technology to operate" and have become an "appealing target" for cyber-attacks. •cyber threat to disrupt start of university termuniversity cyber-attack to take weeks to fix cyber-criminals could be seeking personal information about children or families, and to target the payments process for parents, warns the ncsc. the early years cyber-security advice warns about malicious software, so-called "malware", and the need to protect personal information and data. "cyber-criminals will go after anybody, provided there's money to be made," says the ncsc's advice. the cyber-security agency calls for a more secure approach to sharing information, including newsletters for parents. "you should password protect newsletters so only families who have been given the password can open them," says the guidance. the ncsc says many scam emails are "preying on fears of covid-19" and warns nurseries and child minders to watch out for fake messages trying to obtain information with false claims, including: resetting passwords, receiving compensationmissed deliveries. there are also warnings about protecting computer devices, including smartphones, and to guard against scam phone calls and text messages. education at all age groups has become a significant target for cyber-attacks. a big multi-site further education college, the south and city college birmingham, has been forced to close by a "major ransomware attack" - with the college telling students to stay home this week. universities faced a wave of cyber-attacks last autumn, targeting research and data and causing disruption to computer systems. the ncsc is now widening its advice to the early years sector. sarah lyons, deputy director for economy and society engagement at the ncsc, said across educational settings it was "vital that all providers know how to secure their devices and sensitive data". but she said many people in early years "work on their own, without dedicated it support". "this guidance sets out the practical first steps they can take to protect themselves from cyber-incidents." "like most professions, the early years sector is increasingly reliant on technology, and this new guidance will support them with protecting sensitive data," said vicky ford, children and families minister. "it is paramount that early years settings have robust cyber-security in place to help them communicate with children, families and staff delivering early education and childcare provision safely," she said. a british man hailed as a hero for stopping a global cyber-attack that was threatening the nhs has pleaded guilty to us malware charges. marcus hutchins, 24, has pleaded guilty to two charges related to writing malware - or malicious software - court documents show. writing on his website, hutchins said he regretted his actions and accepted "full responsibility for my mistakes". hutchins has been held in the us since he was arrested by the fbi in 2017. "as you may be aware, i've pleaded guilty to two charges related to writing malware in the years prior to my career in security," he wrote on his website.  "i regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.  "having grown up, i've since been using the same skills that i misused several years ago for constructive purposes. i will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks." british hacker loses bid to omit evidencearrested cyber-expert 'had used drugs' hutchins, from ilfracombe in devon, was credited with stopping the wannacry malware which was threatening the nhs and other organisations in may 2017. but he was arrested by fbi agents on 2 august 2017 at las vegas's mccarran international airport. he had been attending the def con conference - one of the world's biggest hacking and security gatherings. a woman carrying two chinese passports and a device with computer malware allegedly lied to enter us president donald trump's mar-a-lago club.  the woman, yujing zhang, 32, told security she was at the florida club to go to the pool, according to a criminal complaint filed in us district court.  "due to a potential language barrier issue," staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in. mr trump was in palm beach at the time of the incident on saturday 30 march. ms zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an "asian female" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area.  according to the court documents, upon entry to the club ms zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a "united nations chinese american association" event.  the receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of ms zhang.  the suspect was transported off the property for further questioning.  she told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as "charles", to travel from shanghai, china, to palm beach to attend the purported united nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents.  she said "charles" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about chinese-american economic relations, said the affidavit. secret service agent samuel ivanovich said ms zhang carried four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing a computer virus, but no swim suit.  trump must share mar-a-lago visitor logtrump's mar-a-lago cited for food safety'trump cheats at the highest level' in the court document, mr ivanovich notes that ms zhang "freely and without difficulty conversed" in english, becoming "verbally aggressive" with authorities as the investigation progressed.  the secret service said in a statement that it "does not determine who is invited or welcome at mar-a-lago; this is the responsibility of the host entity.  "the mar-a-lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property." ms zhang's lawyer has so far declined comment.  she will remain in custody until a hearing next week.  if convicted, she could face a maximum of five years in prison.  a taiwanese company that makes chips for apple's iphone is back in full production after being infected with malware at the weekend. the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company (tsmc) had to shut down parts of its factories.  it said the attack had featured a "mutation" of the wannacry ransomware. the manufacturing giant denied that it had been hacked and blamed an error during the installation of a new tool that had not been taken offline first. chief executive cc wei told reporters he was "shocked and surprised" that the attack had taken place. "it's impossible that humans would never make mistakes and we have changed the system to automatically detect [the virus] and such a mistake would never be made again," he told reuters. the company did not comment on where the malware may have originated. tsmc's other clients include nvidia and qualcomm. it is often listed as one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers. "the issues suffered by tsmc remind us that any organisation, even those working at the forefront of technology development, can fall victim to malware," said thomas nuth, director of product at cyber-security company nozomi networks. "while downtime can be a frustrating inconvenience for most, when it targets the manufacturing process the results can be exceptionally expensive." police have seized thousands of computers running one of the most dangerous hacking networks worldwide. the emotet network obtains access to victims' computers, via malicious email attachments, then sells it to criminals who install more dangerous malware. police from the uk, eu, us and canada worked together to "disrupt" emotet. europol called it "one of most significant botnets of the past decade" and one of the main "door openers" for computer systems worldwide. "once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware," it said. dmitry smilyanets, from recorded future, said: "even if the creator and his support and operators are not arrested, they likely will not try to rebuild. "they have enough cash to retire in peace - or start a new criminal adventure. "a working botnet is a very complicated and gentle system. "if more than a half of the infrastructure is not working, it's safe to say bye-bye." emotet was initially a banking trojan, designed to spy on victims' computers and steal login details. victims would receive an apparently important word document marked for their attention.  when opened, it would ask them to "enable macros" - a seemingly innocent feature built into microsoft word that actually opened their computer up to attackers. lotem finkelstein, of check point software, said it had been tracking emotet for years. "the most successful and prevalent malware of 2020 by a long way", he said, it had, over the course of the year, sent phishing emails with more than 150,000 different subject lines and 100,000 file names for the attachments. "it constantly adjusted its phishing emails to victims' interests and global events - for example, the covid-19 pandemic or major shopping seasons such as black friday," mr finkelstein said. and although the europol announcement may seem "abstract", it would protect "the public from cyber-threats that have caused losses of millions, if not more, of dollars".  the porn habit of an employee at the us geological survey (usgs) led to a government network becoming infected with malware, an official report has revealed. the employee, who has not been named, had "an extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites". investigators found malware on many of the 9,000 pages he or she accessed. the us office of the inspector general has recommended that the usgs blacklist "rogue" websites. "our analysis confirmed that many of the pornographic images were subsequently saved to an unauthorised usb device and personal android cell phone," the report explained as well as government computers, the employee's personal mobile was also found to be infected. reports of the case were picked up by news site techcrunch, which confirmed that the earth resources observation and science center (eros) does not maintain any classified networks. the site also reported that the malware in question was designed to steal data from infected computers and was "associated" with ransomware attacks. usgs employees are advised not to connect usb devices or mobile phones to government computers - though usb connections are not disabled. an it policy that prevents usb use should be implemented, the us department of the interior suggested. hundreds of uk companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to chinese hackers. cyber-security firm eset said more than 500 email servers in the uk may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. it comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. but some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. the uk's national cyber security centre has joined us authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for uk businesses. meanwhile, the norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. the hacking campaign was first announced by microsoft on 2 march and blamed on a chinese government-backed hacking group called hafnium. microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of us companies. the attackers targeted the popular email system microsoft exchange server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. us warns of 'active threat' over microsoft attackeu bank authority hit by microsoft email hackmicrosoft email server hacks put biden in a bind microsoft released software updates for the so called "zero-day" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. however, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. according to cyber-security researchers at eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.  cyber-researchers at fireeye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in china, using the exploit in different waves. "as always, it is complex but it is very likely that hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled," jake moore at eset said. "the race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers." a webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.  once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. globally, eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the uk. cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. cyberguard technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. the companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. sean tickle, head of cyberguard, said: "it's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. "it only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.  "there's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and i think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this." apps from a well-known cyber-security firm were taken down from the mac app store by apple after they were found to export users' browser histories. several anti-malware apps made by trend micro have since been updated by the cyber-security company. however, trend micro strongly denied allegations that the apps had been "stealing user data" and sending it to a server in china. the apps' behaviour was noticed by a security researcher last week. three apps, dr cleaner, dr antivirus and app uninstall, made by trend micro, were removed from the apple mac app store, though the tech giant has not publicly confirmed why. "reports that trend micro is 'stealing user data' and sending them to an unidentified server in china are absolutely false," said trend micro in a statement. it added that it had completed an initial investigation which had confirmed that several apps, including dr cleaner and dr antivirus, had collected and uploaded "a small snapshot of the browser history on a one-time basis" at installation. the firm said this was done for "security purposes", in order to analyse whether a user had recently encountered adware or other threats. however, it added that it had decided to remove this function from the apps. in an update to the statement, trend micro said, "we apologise to our community for concern they might have felt and can reassure all that their data is safe and at no point was compromised." logs of user browser history, previously held for three months, have now been deleted. the bbc has contacted apple for comment. the uk's competition and markets authority has launched an investigation into whether apple's terms for app developers are anti-competitive. it follows a series of complaints, including a high-profile one from epic games, the developer of fortnite. some developers are unhappy that they are forced to distribute apps to iphones and ipads via the app store, and the commission apple takes. apple said its terms were "fair and equal". the investigation will consider whether apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices and look at whether it imposes unfair terms on developers. andrea coscelli, chief executive of the cma said: "millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. so complaints that apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice - potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps - warrant careful scrutiny." in response, apple said: "we believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. the app store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place - applied fairly and equally to all developers - to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent.  "we look forward to working with the uk competition and markets authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the app store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers."  fortnite-maker sues apple and google in ukapple fires back in fortnite app store battle epic games has launched a legal action against apple and google in the us, after both removed fortnite from their smartphone app stores. the row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the apple app store or the google play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules. in august epic bypassed the apple and google stores to let fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores. the row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians. arizona's state house of representatives passed a law this week which prohibits apple and google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores. the law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in arizona. it will now be handed to the state senate for approval. in europe, apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies. a british cyber-security researcher credited with stopping the spread of the wannacry virus faces four more charges related to separate malware he is alleged to have created. marcus hutchins, who denies the charges, has asked his twitter followers to help with his legal fees.  mr hutchins was arrested at las vegas airport in august last year after he left the black hat conference. he was accused of creating a piece of malware known as kronos. kronos was designed to steal banking credentials. according to a new court filing, mr hutchins is now also accused of creating a second piece of malware, known as upas kit. he is also accused of distributing it with the help of another person. according to the court document, the malware was created in 2012 to be installed silently and not alert anti-virus software. it is alleged to have collected personal information. mr hutchins's lawyer, brian klein, described the new indictment as "meritless". the cyber-security researcher is originally from ilfracombe, devon, and works for la-based company kryptos logic. he shot to fame after helping to stall the wannacry ransomware cyber-attack that struck the nhs and other organisations in may 2017.  the cyber-attack targeted 150 countries and locked down computers, demanding a $300 (£223) fee to restore files. mr hutchins was granted bail on 5 august after $30,000 (£23,000) was raised by friends and family. malware that displays explicit pornographic adverts has been found lurking in 60 apps available on google's play store.  many of the apps infected with the malware are aimed at children, and some have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. the malware also promotes fake security programs and tries to get people to sign up to expensive services. google said it had now removed all the compromised apps from the play store. the "adultswine" malware was discovered by researchers from checkpoint software, which said apps harbouring the code had been downloaded at least three million times. infected apps include add-ons for the hugely popular pocket edition of minecraft as well as apps themed around well known disney characters. the checkpoint researchers uncovered the infected apps as well as the infrastructure used to pipe offensive adverts and other offers to victims.  reviews of infected apps on google's store warned about the presence of the pop-up adverts. checkpoint said adultswine was a "nasty nuisance" that was "most certainly damaging on both an emotional and financial level". in a statement, google said the compromised apps had been purged from the play store and it had shut down the accounts of the developers that had created them. it added that it would "continue to show strong warnings to anyone that has installed them". equifax has taken down a customer help web page amid concerns over malware linked to the site. the firm said it took down the link for credit report assistance "out of an abundance of caution". the problem did not compromise its systems or affect the dispute portal, the firm added in a later update. equifax is still reeling from discovery of a breach that compromised personal data of more than 145.5 million americans and about 8,000 canadians. equifax has also said a file containing names and birthdates of 15.2 million people in the uk were accessed. the firm is contacting nearly 700,000 of them, because more serious information was compromised. the new issue involved a webpage that asked visitors to download fraudulent adobe flash updates, according to ars technica.  the problem was first publicly identified by an independent security analyst. equifax said it had traced the problem to a third-party vendor it used to track website data and removed that vendor's code from the site. "equifax can confirm that its systems were not compromised and that the reported issue did not affect our consumer online dispute portal," the company said.  a scottish health board has apologised after a malware attack meant appointments and procedures had to be cancelled. nhs lanarkshire also warned patients not to attend hospital unless their visit is "essential" and said waiting times may be longer than usual. but the board's chief executive, calum campbell, said the source of the malware had now been indentified. investigations are ongoing into how the malware was able to infect the network. it was not clear if the health service had been deliberately targeted. the cyber attack started on friday. operations were cancelled and the work of gps was disrupted. the health board said it "took immediate action" to put a solution in place and minimise disruption. on saturday morning, nhs lanarkshire confirmed the problems were still affecting its staff bank system, which it uses to ensure shifts are filled on wards and clinics. it asked staff to call a temporary number to check if they were needed to cover shifts over the next 72 hours. mr campbell said staff had been working hard to minimise the impact on patients and contingency plans had been put in place to ensure services could be delivered while the it issues were resolved. "unfortunately a small number of procedures and appointments have been cancelled as a result of the incident," he said. "i would like to apologise to anyone who has been affected by this disruption, however i can assure you that work is already underway to reappoint patients." "the majority of services have been restored but it may take some time to get services running as normal. "we would ask patients who are attending hospital or out-of-hours services over the weekend to bear with us as they may experience longer than waits than usual." nhs lanarkshire was one of the worst-hit health authorities in scotland in the widespread cyber-attacks in may. however, a spokeswoman for the health board said the current issues were "not on the same scale". she said a number of appointments and procedures had been postponed as a result of the current issues, but there were "no concerns around emergency treatments". nhs lanarkshire's hospitals include monklands, wishaw general and hairmyres. the booming price of bitcoin and other crypto-coins has kicked off a gold rush among malicious hackers keen to cash in, warn security firms. many sites are now harbouring code that secretly uses a visitors' computer to mine the valuable e-cash coins. the code is inserted by hackers who exploit poor site security or web software bugs. the problem has led google engineers to consider putting protections against mining in the chrome browser. earlier this month, hundreds of websites were found to be running code created by the coin-hive project. this let the web domains generate coins for the monero crypto-currency by using the processing power of visitors' computers.  while some sites had put the coin-hive code on their site themselves, many others had been hacked to host the short script.  bitcoin, and almost every other crypto-coin, works by using lots of different computers to log and verify who has done what with the electronic coins. in return for carrying out these computational tasks, called mining, users are regularly rewarded with new coins.  palo alto networks said it had found coin-hive on almost 150 separate domains. the most popular locations for the code were porn, video and file-sharing sites.  "the use of coin-hive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity," said yuchen zhou and colleagues at security company palo alto. "it is how they are used that makes the sites malicious." the wide uptake of coin-hive and the surging price of bitcoin, now worth about $5,630 (£4,288) per coin, has led to the creation of many "copycat" coin-mining systems.  security news website bleeping computer has now found 10 separate "clones" of coin-hive that mine different types of coins for their creators. "most are behaving like malware, intruding on users' computers and using resources without permission," wrote catalin cimpanu on the bleeping computer site. on portable devices, the code can drain batteries very quickly. some of the copycat coin-mining programs specifically target popular website creation and admin systems such as wordpress. others, said mr cimpanu, are written in javascript and their creators try to insert them wherever they can. many anti-virus firms have updated their software so they now spot and disable mining software. also, coin-hive has now launched an authorised version of its software which only mines coins if users give their explicit permission. the growing number of coin miners kicked off a discussion among google engineers working on the firm's chrome browser about how to tackle it.  "yes, we should do something about it," wrote ojan vafai, a chrome engineer on the forums where browser changes are debated.  mr vafai suggested getting the browser to watch for situations when mining software grabs lots of processing power from a computer or portable device.  if the browser spots this activity it would "aggressively throttle" browser activity to limit how much number-crunching power can be grabbed. users would also be warned about what was happening.  the change would let users see when their browser was being used for mining and let them choose if it continued. blocking the activity any other way would be difficult, he said. "i'm effectively suggesting we add a permission here, but it would have unusual triggering conditions," he wrote. "it only triggers when the page is doing a likely bad thing."  the mac and ios software developer panic has had the source code for several of its apps stolen. panic founder steven frank admitted in a blog post that it happened after he downloaded an infected copy of the video encoding tool handbrake. he said there was no sign that any customer data was accessed and that panic's web server was not affected. users have been warned to download panic's apps only from its website or the apple app store.  panic is the creator of web editing and file transfer apps coda and transmit, and co-published the video game firewatch with developers campo santo. on 2 may handbrake was hacked, with the mac version of the app on one of the site's download servers replaced by a malicious copy. the infected app was discovered and removed on 6 may. in what mr frank called "a case of extraordinarily bad luck", he downloaded the malicious version of handbrake and launched it "without stopping to wonder why handbrake would need admin privileges… when it hadn't before". "and that was that, my mac was completely, entirely compromised in three seconds or less." wannacry and the malware hall of fameglossary: malware, patches and wormsmalware attack: how to protect yourself online the attacker then used his password to access other private files and copy the source code for several of panic's products stored on the infected computer. the theft was confirmed when panic received an email containing some of the files and demanding a ransom for the return of the complete code. "we're working on the assumption that there's no point in paying," mr frank wrote, saying that "the attacker has no reason to keep their end of the bargain". the fbi is investigating the incident and panic has been working with apple to make sure that no malicious or fake versions of the apps get into the app store. "i feel like a monumental idiot for having fallen for this," mr frank admitted. "it's a good reminder though — no matter how experienced you might be with computers, you're human and mistakes are easily made."  2017 has been a bumper year for malware outbreaks. we had the wannacry worm causing havoc around the world for days, followed most recently by the petya outbreak. but they are not the first to spread so far, so fast. the history of technology and the net has been regularly punctuated by outbreaks and infections.   in 1988, just as the internet was starting to catch on, computer science student robert t morris was curious about just how big it had grown. he wrote a small program that travelled around, logging the servers it visited. bugs in his code made it scan the net very aggressively so every server ended up running multiple copies of the worm. each copy used up a little bit of processing power so the servers gradually slowed to a halt. the scanning traffic clogged the net making it almost unusable. it took days to clean up the infection. mr morris was caught and found guilty of computer fraud and was fined $10,050 (£7,785). these days, he is a computer scientist at the massachussetts institute of technology (mit). the morris worm has one strange parallel with wannacry. mr morris was the son of the nsa's chief scientist and the wannacry worm is based on code stolen from the nsa.  in may 2000, millions of windows users found endless copies of an email bearing the subject line iloveyou in their inboxes. it spread so far and so fast thanks to the booby-trapped file attached to it. opening the file fired up the small program it contained which sent a copy of the same message to all the addresses found in a victim's address book. it was also helped to spread because all those messages appeared to come from someone a recipient knew. and the subject line made people curious too. iloveyou rattled around the world for almost two weeks racking up more than 50 million infections. high-profile victims included the cia, pentagon and uk parliament.  philippine students reonel ramones and onel de guzman were found to be the creators of iloveyou. they escaped prosecution because there were no computer misuse laws in the philippines at that time. active in july 2001 and named after the fizzy pop being drunk by the researchers who found it, this worm targeted web servers running microsoft iis software.  it caused severe disruption and many websites, small businesses and larger firms were knocked offline for a while.  no-one has ever been named as code red's creator although on servers it compromised it displayed a message suggesting it originated in china.  like wannacry, code red exploited a known bug and caught out servers that had not been updated with a patch.  this worm emerged in january 2003 and was so virulent that it is believed to have slowed down traffic across the entire net as it spread. slammer was a tiny program, roughly 376 bytes, that did little more than create random net addresses and then send itself to those places. if it hit a machine running a vulnerable version of microsoft's sql server, that machine got infected and then started spraying out more copies seeking more victims. the slowdown was caused by net routers struggling to cope with the massive amounts of traffic slammer generated while seeking out new hosts.  again, a patch was available for the bug it exploited but many people had not applied it despite it being available for six months. this windows email worm from january 2004 is believed to hold the current record for spreading fastest - hardly surprising given that it was reputedly created by professional spammers.  it worked so well thanks to a clever bit of social engineering. the email bearing the worm was designed to look like an error message. this fiction was aided by the message's attachment which purported to hold a copy of the email that did not arrive.  opening the attachment kicked off the malicious code that re-sent the same message to everyone in a victim's address book. november 2008 saw the arrival of this virulent worm which hit up to 15 million servers running microsoft software. it ran rampant and caught out hospitals, governments, the armed forces and many businesses.  the outbreak was so bad that microsoft offered a $250,000 reward for any information leading to the identification of the worm's creator. no-one has ever been identified as its originator.  a patch closing the loophole it exploited was released by microsoft about a month after it appeared. even today, 10 years on, data traffic generated by machines infected with conficker regularly turn up.  the comments section of britney spears' instagram account has been used by cyber-thieves to co-ordinate attacks. security firm eset found the gang controlled its malware, called turla, by posting comments about images in the singer's gallery. the comments looked like spam but once transformed by code in the virus, directed victims to other sites. several other compromised websites were also being used to track victims and spread the malware. turla has been active since 2014 and sought to catch out government workers, diplomats and other officials, said eset researcher jean-ian boutin. it is believed to be run by a hacker group working for the russian state.  most often, he said, turla's handlers compromised websites that targets would be likely to visit.  one compromised server asked visitors to install a booby-trapped extension for the firefox web browser.  digital detective work by mr boutin revealed that the command and control (c&c) channel set up between the creators of the extension and victims' machines was on the singer's instagram page.  the malicious extension searched for comments that, when digitally transformed, matched a specific value. these were then converted into a website address that the compromised machine visited to report in or to update the malicious code they harboured.  very few comments posted to the instagram account had the key characteristics - suggesting that turla's creators were testing or refining the control system. mr boutin said using social media in this way made "life harder for defenders". "firstly, it is difficult to distinguish malicious traffic to social media from legitimate traffic," he wrote. "secondly, it gives the attackers more flexibility when it comes to changing the c&c address as well as erasing all traces of it." mr boutin added that he had been in touch with mozilla, which was working on ways to stop extensions for firefox being compromised in this way.   in a statement, instagram said: "we are aware of this activity and have taken action against the responsible accounts." more than 36 million android devices may have been infected with ad-click malware, a security firm has said. researchers at check point said they found the malware, dubbed judy, on about 50 apps in google's play store. the apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. the infected apps have been removed from the play store. more than 40 of the apps were from the south korean developer, kiniwini, which publishes games to the play store under the name enistudio. the games, all of which feature a character called judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times. the malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers. "it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly," said check point. between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times. check point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the judy games had been updated since march this year. the oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in april 2016, which check point suggested, means that "the malicious code hid for a long time on the play store undetected". because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. the apps got past the play store's protection system, google bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the judy code. once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts. this kind of delivery "has become commonplace", andrew smith, a senior lecturer in networking at the open university, told the bbc. "there are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up." the apps also display numerous adverts themselves, some of which cannot be closed until a user has clicked on them. a russian cybersecurity firm has issued a warning about a spate of remotely coordinated attacks on cash machines. hacks of banks' centralised systems had made groups of machines issue cash simultaneously, a process known as "touchless jackpotting", said group ib. the machines had not been physically tampered with, it said, but "money mules" had waited to grab the cash. affected countries are said to include armenia, estonia, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain and the uk. but the company declined to name any specific banks. dmitriy volkov from group ib told the bbc a successful attack could net its perpetrators up to $400,000 (£320,000) at a time. "we have seen such attacks in russia since 2013," he said. "the threat is critical. attackers get access to an internal bank's network and critical information systems. that allows them to rob the bank." two cash machine manufacturers, diebold nixdorf and ncr corp, told reuters they were aware of the threat. "they are taking this to the next level in being able to attack a large number of machines at once," said senior director nicholas billett, from diebold nixdorf.  "they know they will be caught fairly quickly, so they stage it in such a way that they can get cash from as many atms as they can before they get shut down." a recent report by europol warned of the rise of cash-machine-related malware, although it said "skimming" - using hardware to steal card information at the machine itself - was still more common. "the new method is being done by somehow gaining access to the banks' central systems and infecting whole communities of atms simultaneously, hence multiplying the amount of money that can be stolen in a short time," said surrey university's cybersecurity expert prof alan woodward. because criminals were collecting the cash in person, it made the crime more difficult to trace, he added. "the classic way of solving online financial crime is to 'follow the money' - but when you can no longer do this, it is very hard to find out who is behind it, even though the evidence suggests it is a very limited number of groups that have started perpetrating this type of crime." security experts say a sharp increase in ransomware attacks is in part a result of how easy the malware is to acquire.researchers at cylance and alienvault were able to find off-the-shelf ransomware using a normal search engine, which could then be used to lock victims' computer files and blackmail them.hiding out among the net's criminalshow long until ukraine is hacked again?pay your fare using a 3d face mapcash machine hacked in five minutessee more at click's website and @bbcclick.this week bbc news is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security. the coverage is timed to coincide with the two biggest shows in the security calendar - black hat and def con. follow all our coverage via this link app-based guides for games, including fifa and pokemon go, were used to target more than 500,000 android users with malware, a cyber-security company has said. the apps, discovered on the google play store, were designed to take control of devices before downloading malware. unwanted ads could then be displayed to users, for example, according to researchers at check point. google did not respond to a request for comment. more than 40 guide apps for popular games were found to be capable of delivering the malware to users' devices, check point said. it is thought that the apps were downloaded between 528,000 and 1.8 million times, though it is not known how many of these downloads resulted in the deployment of malware. "since the actual apps do not contain any malicious code themselves, it's very hard to trace," said daniel padon, at check point. he added that when check point had notified google about the apps they had been removed. but the researchers said that they continued to find more examples on the play store. some of the apps were made available as long ago as november last year. when one is downloaded, it asks users for device admin permission to ensure the software cannot be deleted. it then attempts to establish a connection with a command and control server, turning the device into a bot in a botnet - a network of devices controlled from afar. malicious software can then be downloaded. mr padon told the bbc that this could allow hackers to send illegitimate pop-up ads, use the device as part of a ddos attack, or snoop on data sent via the device's network. he said mobile botnets were becoming more common.  "we, other security vendors and google have found different mobile botnets spreading via the play store," mr padon said. "this is a hard thing to stop - it could have a devastating impact." the approach could indeed be dangerous, agreed nikolaos chrysaidos at cyber-security firm avast. "at the moment, it seems like the cyber-criminals behind the threat are only interested in making money from ads," he said. "the threat currently has very basic functionalities [...] however, there is nothing stopping the threat from becoming more sophisticated in the future." a man who told the fbi he had remotely accessed hundreds of webcams to spy on people across the world should not be extradited, a judge has ruled. christopher taylor, 57 and from wigan, tricked 772 people in 39 countries into downloading malware from 2012 to 2015. in 2016, after a us college discovered the programme, he told police and fbi he used it to take images and videos. however, district judge michael fanning ruled that extradition to the us "would not be in the interests of justice". westminster magistrates court was told the married father-of-three was wanted in the us to face trial on an indictment alleging one offence of wire fraud and two of computer fraud. the court heard remote access tools were found on mr taylor's computer along with 772 files - one per victim - containing hundreds of saved webcam images, "including images of people in various stages of undress and involved in sexual activity". his lawyer ben cooper qc argued that as "only 7% of the victims were based in the us at the time with 93% outside of the us", including several in the uk, mr taylor should face proceedings in england, where a criminal investigation has yet been launched. he added in written submissions that the 57-year-old had not used the malware for "sexual gratification" or targeted anyone in particular, but had an "obsessive interest in computers and hacking". in a written ruling, judge fanning said none of the people whose webcams were accessed were aware of mr taylor's "illicit observation of them [and] certainly, none of them consented to it". however, he said he did "find extradition would not be in the interests of justice", but added that the us government "can appeal or they may choose to provide evidence to the authorities in the uk, so you can be prosecuted here". daniel sternberg, representing the us government, indicated there would be an appeal. mr taylor was granted conditional bail. why not follow bbc north west on facebook, twitter and instagram? you can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk the "shadow brokers" hacker group has released malware allegedly created by the us national security agency (nsa). the group, which earlier tried to sell the encrypted cache of hacking tools in an online auction, released a password for it via a blog on 8 april. some cyber-security experts have said some of the malware is real, but old. the nsa has not commented on the hacker group or the material that was released over the weekend. the shadow brokers said they had published the password as a "protest" about us president donald trump. the group wanted "america to be great again", the blog added. it criticised, among other things, "[steve] bannon's removal from the [national security council]" and the "us military strike on syria". a list of alleged nsa hacking targets and the malware allegedly installed at them was also included in the release, according to some cyber-security experts. the shadow brokers say they are "not fans of russia or putin", but some experts have suggested the group may have links with the russian government. "russia is quickly responding to the missile attacks on syria with the release of the dump file password that was previously withheld," said jake williams, chief executive of cyber-security firm rendition infosec in a blog.   a similar opinion was shared on twitter by dan gonzales, a senior scientist at the rand corporation think tank. the shadow brokers were "probably a front for or infiltrated by #russia #cyber groups," he said. neither commentator gave any evidence to support such claims. russian officials have not commented but have strenuously denied involvement in other hacking cases associated with the us. "if russia had stolen the hacking tools, it would be senseless to publicise the theft, let alone put them up for sale," cyber-security expert james bamford wrote in an article for reuters news agency. he suggested that the shadow brokers could be an nsa "insider".  in a separate case, a series of cyber-attacks on 40 targets in 16 countries have been linked to a cache of hacking tools, according to cybersecurity firm symantec. the cache, known as vault7, was published online by wikileaks and said to contain malware used by the central intelligence agency (cia). the agency has not confirmed whether it authored the tools. the malware analysed by symantec had been used to infect computers in europe, asia and the middle east. "on one occasion a computer in the united states was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally," symantec noted. the malware contained logs documenting changes that closely mirrored such records in vault7 malware, the firm claimed. a russian man faces up to 10 years in jail for spreading a computer virus that cost victims more than $500m (£401m). mark vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the citadel trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom. us prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide.  he pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud, in a court in atlanta, after being extradited from norway. launched in 2011, citadel was marketed on invitation-only, russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals. its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said.  vartanyan admitted to the "development, improvement, maintenance and distribution" of citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in ukraine and norway. operating under the alias kolypto, he uploaded "numerous electronic files" that consisted of citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information. earlier in march, david levalley, special agent at the fbi atlanta office, said vartanyan's arrest removed "a significant player" from the resources available to cybercriminals. "we must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the american people," he said. vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. he will be sentenced in june.  in september 2015, a us court sentenced russian citizen dimitry belorossov to four years and six months in prison after he admitted distributing and installing citadel on to computers. the department of justice said its investigation into the creator of citadel continued.  iran is running two surveillance operations in cyber-space, targeting more than 1,000 dissidents, according to a leading cyber-security company. the efforts were directed against individuals in iran and 12 other countries, including the uk and us, check point said. it said the two groups involved were using new techniques to install spyware on targets' pcs and mobile devices. and this was then being used to steal call recordings and media files. one of the groups, known as domestic kitten or apt-50, is accused of tricking people into downloading malicious software on to mobile phones by a variety of means including: repackaging an existing version of an authentic video game found on the google play storemimicking an app for a restaurant in tehranoffering a fake mobile-security appproviding a compromised app that publishes articles from a local news agencysupplying an infected wallpaper app containing pro-islamic state imagerymasquerading as an android application store to download further software the american-israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries. there had been more than 600 successful infections, it said. the second group, known as infy or prince of persia, is said to spy on the home and work pcs of dissidents in 12 countries, extracting sensitive data after tricking people into opening malicious email attachments. the iranian government has not commented on the report. domestic kitten's operation was first identified in 2018. and check point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017. four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in november 2020.  and it was using an iranian blog site, telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed furball, which could: record calls and other soundstrack the device's locationcollect device identifiers,grab text messages and call logssteal media files, including videos and photos,obtain a list of other installed applicationssteal files from external storage the 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the kurdish ethnic minority in: iranthe usgreat britainpakistanafghanistanturkeyuzbekistan the other group, infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007.  its most recent activity had targeted pcs, with fake emails with attractive content, usually with an attached document, check point said. one example provided was of a document apparently about loans being offered to disabled veterans. once the document was opened, a spying tool was installed and sensitive data stolen, the company said. two documents recently used are said to have included a photo of an iranian governor, with alleged contact details. the researchers said infy's capabilities were "far superior" to most other known iranian campaigns, thanks to its ability to be highly selective about its targets and to have generally have gone undetected. "it is clear that the iranian government is investing significant resources into cyber-operations," check point cyber-research head yaniv balmas said. "the operators of these iranian cyber-espionage campaigns seem to be completely unaffected by any counter-activities done by others, even though both campaigns had been revealed and even stopped in the past. "they have simply restarted." the association of british insurers (abi) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies. it said insurance was "not an alternative" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk. however, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover. prof ciaran martin, former head of the national cyber security centre, said the uk needed to rethink its policies on ransomware. ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold. there are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch. the guardian reported that prof martin, now at oxford university's blavatnik school of government, said he believed insurers were "funding organised crime" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the bbc the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector. while official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the uk, he said. "i have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay." while the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating. when the global aluminium producer norsk hydro was attacked in 2019, it cost the firm around £45m, and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%, reported reuters.   norsk hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance. a spokesman for the abi said insurers do require that "reasonable precautions" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves. "some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security," he said. prof martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem. "but it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse," he said. ransomware called wannacry has spread across 150 countries, earned its makers about $50,000 (£39,000) so far and in doing so, thrown some hospitals in england in to disarray as doctors could not access patient records. it was the story of the weekend and is still ongoing - but if the terms involved were new to you, read on. malware short for "malicious software", this is a programme written to disrupt computers or the networks between them. wannacry falls in to this category. ransomware  a programme that scrambles a computer's files, demanding payment before they can be opened again. wannacry asked for $300 in a virtual currency. ransomware is not new, but wannacry spread to more computers than previous ransomware attacks - and, because it hit computers used in hospital trusts, had a bigger impact that previous attempts. virus a type of malware that spreads when people do things like inserting usb sticks with viruses in them, and downloading infected files. these are the reason why we are all warned not to open attachments in unexpected emails. worm a type of virus that can spread from computer to computer by itself. is my computer at risk?security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident'should you pay the ransom? vulnerability a flaw in software that can be exploited to disrupt computers or networks patch a software update that fixes a vulnerability. these do not exist for operating systems that are no longer supported by their makers. operating system the important software that makes the whole computer run, from the user interface to memory, security, and applications. this might be ios on an iphone, android on other smartphones, mac os x, linux or windows. companies release new operating systems every few years; microsoft's latest is windows 10, which followed windows 8.1. windows xp, was first released in 2001 - a long time ago in technology terms - and microsoft stopped supporting it in 2014. that means they stopped issuing security updates for vulnerabilities. bitcoin a digital currency, in which the wannacry makers asked for their ransom payments. it is easy to keep offline identities private when using bitcoin. the value of the currency fluctuates considerably, making it difficult to meet a ransom payment exactly.  kill switch  a way to shut down the spread of a virus or worm.  a 22-year-old security specialist from england found wannacry's kill switch accidentally while trying to track its spread. but he and others have warned that the people behind wannacry could change it to get around the kill switch he found. up to 10 million android smartphones have been infected by malware that generates fake clicks for adverts, say security researchers. the software is also surreptitiously installing apps and spying on the browsing habits of victims.  the malware is currently making about $300,000 (£232,000) a month for its creators, suggests research. the majority of phones that have been compromised by the malicious software are in china. a spike in the number of phones infected by the malware was noticed separately by security companies checkpoint and lookout. the malware family is called shedun by lookout but hummingbad by checkpoint  in a blogpost, checkpoint said it had obtained access to the command-and-control servers that oversee infected phones which revealed that hummingbad was now on about 10 million devices. china, india, the philippines and indonesia top the list of nations with most phones infected by the software.  hummingbad is a type of malware known as a rootkit that inserts itself deep inside a phone's operating system to help it avoid detection and to give its controllers total control over the handset.  the ability to control phones remotely has been used to click on ads to make them seem more popular than they actually are. the access has also been used to install fake versions of popular apps or spread programs the gang has been paid to promote.  "it can remain persistent even if the user performs a factory reset," wrote kristy edwards from lookout in a blogpost. "it uses its root privileges to install additional apps on to the device, further increasing ad revenue for the authors and defeating uninstall attempts." ms edwards said the recent spike in infections could be driven by the gang behind the malware adding more functions or using their access to phones for different purposes. the malware gets installed on handsets by exploiting loopholes in older versions of the android operating system known as kitkat and jellybean. the latest version of android is known as marshmallow.  in a statement, google said: ""we've long been aware of this evolving family of malware and we're constantly improving our systems that detect it. we actively block installations of infected apps to keep users and their information safe." google released the latest security update for android this month and it tackled more than 108 separate vulnerabilities in the operating system. so far this year, security updates for android have closed more than 270 bugs. an online archive of old computer malware has attracted more than 100,000 visitors since it launched four days ago. some of the software showed an animation or messages. others invited the infected user to play a game. many of the viruses were created by "happy hackers" rather than organised criminals, said cybersecurity expert and curator mikko hypponen. the malware all dates from the 1980s and 1990s. the versions online have all been stripped of their destructive capabilities, but show the messages they would have displayed within emulator windows. much of the collection is mischievous and colourful in nature, but there was also more sinister malware around. "i only chose interesting viruses," mr hypponen said of his picks. his personal favourite is a virus called casino, which overwrote a crucial part of the computer's file system but took a copy of personal files and then offered the user the opportunity to win them back in a game of jackpot. "casino was a real problem," mr hypponen, who works at security firm f-secure, told the bbc. "at the time the advice was, you lose nothing by playing. in the early 1990s very few people had back-ups so you had lost your files anyway." he said he was surprised by the number of people who felt nostalgic about the old malware. "most of the malware we analyse today is coming from organised criminal groups... and intelligence agencies," mr hyponnen added.  "old school happy hackers who used to write viruses for fun are nowhere to be seen." us federal agencies have launched a criminal investigation into the public release of documents said to detail cia hacking tools, us officials say. they told us media that the fbi and cia were co-ordinating the inquiry after wikileaks published thousands of files.  these carried claims that the cia had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart tv microphones. the cia, fbi and white house have declined to comment on the authenticity of the files leaked on tuesday. a cia spokesperson told the bbc on wednesday: "the american public should be deeply troubled by any wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community's ability to protect america against terrorists and other adversaries.   "such disclosures not only jeopardise us personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm." cia faces huge problem over malware claims cia hack:  should we be worried? on wednesday, the us officials - who spoke on the condition of anonymity - told us media that the criminal investigation was looking into how the files came into wikileaks' possession. the inquiry would also try to establish whether the disclosure was a breach from inside or outside the cia, the officials added. the cia has not confirmed whether the documents - said to date between 2013 to 2016 - are real.  but one of its former chiefs was concerned by their publication. "if what i have read is true, then this seems to be an incredibly damaging leak in terms of the tactics, techniques, procedures and tools that were used by the central intelligence agency to conduct legitimate foreign intelligence," ex-cia director michael hayden told the bbc. "in other words, it's made my country and my country's friends less safe." several of the tech firms whose products have been allegedly compromised by the cia gave their first reactions on wednesday. apple said it had already addressed some of the vulnerabilities. "the technology built into today's iphone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way," it said. samsung - whose f8000 series of televisions was reportedly compromised - said that "protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at samsung". the leaks also claimed that the cia had created malware to target pcs running microsoft's windows operating system. "we are aware of the report and are looking into it," a spokesman from microsoft said. google has also reacted to claims that the cia was able to "penetrate, infest and control" android phones due to its discovery and acquisition of "zero day" bugs - previously unknown flaws in the operating system's code. "as we've reviewed the documents, we're confident that security updates and protections in both chrome and android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities," the firm told the news site recode. "our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections. we've always made security a top priority and we continue to invest in our defences." the world wide web foundation - which campaigns for internet privacy - said the us government needed to issue a detailed response. the wikileaks claims are a prominent talking point in china's media, with many outlets warning chinese citizens to take extra safety precautions. influential regional daily chengdu commercial daily tells readers to "update device software, don't leave tvs on standby, and don't read confidential documents on your phone".  nationalist newspaper global times says that the report "shows the need for cyber rules".  russian media have also given extensive coverage to the claims.  russia's english-language channel rt was quick to point to suggestions that the revelations "could be used to prove that allegations of russian hacking are actually a secret us plot".  russia's main domestic tv channels do not question the claims and insist instead on their likely authenticity. channel one tv says that the "cia has created a cyber bomb", adding that "the scandal is only going to gain momentum".  a technology expert found a hidden kill-switch among the computer code in the virus that hit organisations around the world on friday. the expert - from the malware tech blog - told the bbc's newshour programme how he stumbed on the fix. malicious software lurking in unprotected wi-fi routers is feeding the illicit online market for fake social media "likes".  the "stealthy" linux/moose botnet has one goal: infecting connected devices with malware in order to create and sell social media credibility. researchers have been tracking the botnet since 2015. now they have new research into what they call the "ego market" for fake online fame the botnet is feeding.  canadian researchers masarah-cynthia paquet-clouston, a criminologist with the university of montreal, and olivier bilodeau, with cybersecurity consultancy firm  gosecure, are behind the award-winning research into the lucrative world of buying and selling "followers" and "likes" on social media networks. canadians want more done to curb abuse on social mediahow can facebook fix its fake news problem?china 'flooding' social media with fake postsinside the world of ghana's internet fraudsters ms paquet-clouston said it is a global marketplace, with buyers from "brazil, kuwait, china, everywhere. it seems to be worldwide."  so who is seeking out all this fake online credibility and profile?  accounts of aspiring celebrities and models, small businesses, and online retailers are those typically buying batches of "likes" openly advertised for sale online. average people are also paying to inflate their social media presence.  "there are a lot, a lot, a lot of just common people looking for fame," she said. because so many of the accounts that bought the fake likes were "highly self-centered," they dubbed it the "ego market".  ms paquet-clouston also said the fraud scheme being run by the linux/moose botnet creators is an almost perfect crime, with no direct victims and a lot of potential profitability.  the average price for 1,000 instragram follows is $15.98 (£12.80), although the researchers note there is a huge pricing range. creating fake social media accounts that then like and follow other accounts is not illegal but it goes against the terms of service of social media networks like instagram. the purchase of facebook and instagram likes and twitter followers is openly advertised online.  "what's illegal and criminal is doing it through a botnet, through infected devices," ms paquet-clouston said.  the botnet can take advantage of all kinds of connected devices like routers, even "smart" appliances like fridges, toasters, and coffeemakers because, unlike most home computers, they lack antivirus and security software.  the malicious program got its name because the file containing its attack code is called elan - french for moose. ms paquet-clouston and mr bilodeau hope that their research will spur law enforcement and hosting providers to do more to target this criminal scheme. "if we don't raise people's awareness on social media fraud, there's a demand and there's a supply and it's likely to continue," said ms paquet-clouston. they next part of their research is looking for online actors behind the botnet.  a sophisticated form of malware known as project sauron went undetected for five years at a string of organisations, according to security researchers. the malware may have been designed by a state-sponsored group. it can disguise itself as benign files and does not operate in predictable ways, making it harder to detect. experts from kaspersky lab and symantec said it allows the attacker to spy on infected computers. in september last year, kaspersky first detected the malware on an unspecified "government organisation" network. since then, the firm claims to have found evidence of project sauron at more than 30 organisations in russia, iran and rwanda. these were generally government, scientific, military, telecoms and financial organisations, according to kaspersky. separately, symantec said it had found the malware in other countries, including at an airline in china and an embassy in belgium. project sauron is able to disguise itself in a wide variety of ways - as files with names similar to those published by organisations like microsoft, for example, and does not always use the same methods for sending data back to the attacker. "the attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns," the company notes in its report. "remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover." the malware can steal files, log all keystrokes and open a "back door" allowing wide-ranging access to the compromised computer, according to symantec. project sauron did not share any code with other known examples of similarly powerful malware, said kaspersky's director of threat research costin raiu. "it really stands out by itself as something very, very sophisticated," he told the bbc. mr raiu also pointed out that two of the malware's victims had been infected with other highly sophisticated malicious programs. one victim was found to have regin spyware on their systems, for example. "this would suggest that the actor behind project sauron is perhaps different," suggested mr raiu. one aspect of project sauron that demonstrates the malware's sophistication is its ability to steal sensitive data - such as encryption keys - from computers that are not actually connected to the internet. this is known as "jumping the air-gap". for this, project sauron relies on an infected usb drive being inserted into the target computer. a hidden cache of files on the drive is then able to deposit malware on to that pc. it is not yet clear how the attackers would have used this method to control an air-gapped computer, but they believe it might have been via a "zero day" - previously undetected - exploit that they have not yet found. "we believe it was probably deployed in rare, hard-to-catch instances," notes the kaspersky report. project sauron is characteristic of state-sponsored style malware, according to cybersecurity expert graham cluley. "these are very stealthy, insidious attacks that can lurk in the background for years gathering information," he told the bbc. "we have seen the steady progression and evolution of these sorts of attacks. as governments try to protect themselves and get clued up, it is essentially an arms race." one of the biggest networks of spam-sending computers in the world has gone quiet, puzzling experts, internet security firms have said. for years the necurs botnet has distributed junk mail and malware for many different groups of cyber-thieves. but the amount of malicious traffic emerging from necurs has now dwindled to almost nothing. it is not clear what has caused the slowdown and whether traffic will return to previously high levels. one of the first signs of the disruption was seen earlier this month when email messages spreading the dridex banking trojan and locky ransomware caught by security firms dried up. typically, millions of messages bearing these malicious programs are sent out every week,  proofpoint said in a blogpost. however, the flood of messages "essentially stopped" last week, it said. investigations revealed that these messages typically travelled via the necurs botnet which was found to have gone largely offline. the necurs botnet is believed to be made up of about six million compromised windows machines, many of which were enrolled when their owners inadvertently fell victim to a form of malware known as a rootkit. analysis of some of the machines known to be part of necurs shows that its core administration systems have disappeared, said proofpoint. "data from a variety of sources show that necurs bots are actively looking for a new command and control (c&c) system, but we have no evidence that the necurs botmaster has been able to retake control of the botnet." a botnet's c&c system helps the network keep running and co-ordinates the distribution of any spam or malware being sent out via the global collection of computers. security researchers who monitor botnets and the groups that operate them said the cause of the shutdown remained a mystery. "we cannot confirm how the botnet was brought down yet," joonho sa, a researcher for fireeye, told tech news site motherboard. usb sticks containing harmful malware have been left in australian letterboxes, police in victoria have warned. residents of pakenham, a suburb of melbourne, have reportedly found the unmarked sticks in the boxes. plugging them into a computer triggers fraudulent media-streaming service offers, as well as other malware, the force said in a statement. the devices are "extremely harmful" and should not be used, police say. it is not uncommon for usb sticks to be used to carry and transmit destructive malware and viruses to computers. cybersecurity experts have called the technology "critically flawed", and in 2014 demonstrated to the bbc how any usb device could be used to infect a computer without the user's knowledge. berlin-based researchers karsten nohl and jakob lell said a device that appeared to be completely empty could still contain a virus. stuxnet, one of the most sophisticated known pieces of malware, was deployed to attack iranian nuclear centrifuges. it is believed to have been carried on an infected usb stick. the virus infected the internal network of computers running windows, and attacked siemens industrial control software in order to over-ride the system. andrew tierney, consultant at cybersecurity firm pen test partners, said the use of infected usb sticks to target households was very rare. "however, it's still a common form of attacking businesses, where the gains are much greater," he said.  "most cybercriminals are looking for volume, so it's much easier to get hold of people's information by phishing. it's unclear whether the devices were sent in the post, but putting a usb stick in someone's letterbox by visiting the property and potentially getting your fingerprints on them creates a much greater risk of getting caught."  the university of illinois conducted an experiment earlier this year, dropping 297 usb drives around its campus. had the sticks been infected, the attack would have had an estimated success rate of between 45% and 98%, the study found. "you'd be surprised at how many people would fall for plugging an unknown usb stick into their computer. some users may become distrustful at the stage only when the software asks them to download a program, but word files can still be harmful," said mr tierney. peter says that the cyber-attacks on his company are relentless. "we see tens of different hacking attacks every single week. it is never ending." a senior computer network manager for a global financial services company, peter (who did not want to give his surname, or the name of his employer, due to his firm's anxieties surrounding cyber-security), says they are bombarded from all directions. "we see everything," he says. "staff get emails sent to them pretending to be from the service desk, asking them to reset their log-in passwords. "we see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent whatsapp messages pretending to be from the ceo, asking for money transfers. "and having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone." with one in three uk workers currently based exclusively at home, and the same level in the us, this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the it security bosses of companies large and small around the world. and studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. for example, one in five uk home workers has received no training on cyber-security, according to a recent survey by legal firm hayes connor solicitors.  the report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first. meanwhile, a separate uk study last year found that 57% of it decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach. "in the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored," says christine sabino, a senior associate at hayes connor. "companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication." so what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible? ted harrington, a san diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of hackable: how to do application security right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. while many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but mr harrington stresses its importance. "supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company," he says. "this alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants." definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says sam grubb, an arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book how cybersecurity really works. "the main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it," he says. "so while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing. "this makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. this might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers." mr harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a vpn or virtual private network, so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company. mr grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how vpns work. "a vpn is like a tunnel between two cities," he says. "instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side." however, even with work laptops, vpns and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a "phishing" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data. currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine. they ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer. new tech economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. for this reason, both mr harrington and mr grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training. "firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face," says mr grubb.  ms sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. she says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out. with even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, mr harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to. "if an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination," he says. "you don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes." tsedal neeley, a professor of business administration from harvard business school who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. "engaging with their firm's it/cyber-security experts is crucial," she says. peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. "users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your it department. it is better to check than be compromised." the gossip news site perezhilton.com has exposed recent visitors to malware, according to a cybersecurity alert. california-based cyphort labs said that it had detected ads placed on the site being used to spread harmful code on two separate visits during one week. the celebrity scandal site has not yet commented but was known to have suffered a similar problem last year. experts suggested users install ad-blocking plug-ins to defend themselves. the phenomenon is known as "malvertising", and users do not have to click on the ads to find their device infected. perezhilton.com is far from being the only publisher to have hosted the threat. cyphort identified 1,654 unique domains that had fallen victim to the parasitical attack in 2015, and said it believed it was on course to see more than 2,000 instances this year. the new york times, aol and bbc.com are among other popular sites thought to have been hijacked in this way. since january. "malvertising is effective because users tend to trust mainstream, high-trafficked "clean" websites," security researcher nick bilogorskiy blogged. "the attackers abuse this trust to infect them via third-party ad content." perezhilton.com says it is visited by 12 million people every month. in the first instance on 30 april, the firm said perezhilton.com's ads caused users to download the angler exploit kit, which is used to distribute a range of infections including ransomware. then on 2 may, it said a different type of exploit kit was spread via the site. if the users had anti-virus software installed they may have been protected against some of the threats. but in many cases they would not have known they had been exposed. like many sites, perezhilton.com does not check each advert that appears on its pages but instead relies on third parties to place them, sharing the revenue they generate. "the only organisations which understand the full scale of the threat are the advertising networks themselves, and they don't want to draw attention to their own failure to vet their clients," commented dr steven murdoch, a security expert at university college london. cyphort noted that users could protect themselves by installing ad-blocking extensions for their web browser. dr murdoch concurred but questioned whether this was a long-term solution. "ad-blockers offer a temporary mitigation against these problems but if everyone starts using them the current business model of the web will no longer be sustainable," he said. "other options for keeping the web running include asking users to pay for services - subscriptions - but few websites have been able to make this work." the independent newspaper's blogging platform has been briefly compromised with malware that infects readers' computers, security experts have said. researchers from trend micro found blogs on the website had been modified to install malware known as cryptesla on readers' devices. the malware holds files on the host machine to ransom and demands a payment to restore them. the independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated. "it appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware," said a spokesman for the newspaper.  "there is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this." the spokesman said the site affected was an old or "legacy" system that was now rarely visited.  according to trend micro, the ransomware has been present on the independent blogs website since at least 21 november. "we reported it to them on tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening," said raimund genes, chief technical officer at trend micro. "now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours." the malware exploits a security hole in adobe flash player to install itself on a victim's computer. once downloaded, it sets about encrypting documents, rendering them useless without the key to decrypt them, for which it demands a ransom. the vulnerability in flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk. "for a while on tuesday, the malware didn't trigger. but that was not the independent solving it, it was the attackers updating the malware with a new version," said mr genes. "my advice is to update your flash player. always do it immediately when it says an update is available, because flash remains one of the main ways attackers can compromise a system." the spokesperson added that the media group was now looking into the incident.  "we are currently investigating third-party advertising suppliers that are used by our externally hosted blog platform independent blogs, which is a separate entity to independent.co.uk," they said. "less than 0.2% of the independent digital audience visited this separate, legacy blogsite in the entire month of november," the spokesman added. more and more cyber criminals are seeking to subvert adverts in a bid to catch out visitors to popular sites.  this so-called malvertising has been found on many other places. other newspapers as well as streaming sites and porn hosts have all briefly hosted booby-trapped ads. a latvian man has pleaded guilty to creating malware that stole millions of dollars from online bank accounts.  deniss calovskis admitted in a new york court hearing that he had been hired to write part of the gozi computer virus. the code calovskis wrote changed banking websites and helped make the virus more effective.  gozi was first found in 2007 but remained active for years and is thought to have infected more than one million computers worldwide. "i knew what i was doing was against the law," calovskis said in court, answering charges of conspiring to commit computer intrusion.  calovskis was extradited to the us from latvia in february after lengthy negotiations between the two nations over the potential sentence he would serve.  latvian government officials initially resisted calls to hand over calovskis, saying us plans to sentence him to more than 60 years in jail did not represent "proportionate punishment".  a plea agreement on sentencing reached with lawyers representing calovskis means he will not appeal against any jail sentence of two years or less.  it is not clear whether the 10 months calovskis spent in jail in latvia during the extradition row will count as part of the sentence he eventually receives.  he is scheduled to be sentenced on 14 december. two other men have been arrested in connection with the creation and administration of gozi. russian national nikita kuzmin is in jail in the us following his arrest in may 2011 on separate hacking and fraud charges.  extradition proceedings against romanian mihai ionut paunescu are currently on hold pending an appeal. network tools specialist solarwinds has updated its flagship orion software, 11 days after revealing a major breach.  on 13 december, it disclosed that orion had been compromised. it was used as a means to penetrate us government networks and companies including intel. it was later revealed that the product had also been compromised by malware from a suspected second perpetrator, adding a separate backdoor. solarwinds said industry experts were helping it investigate the attacks. the texas-based company provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients including british accountants deloitte, us chip-maker nvidia and the californian cloud-computer software firm vmware. a uk security source told the bbc a small number of british organisations had probably been affected. some experts have warned it could take more than a year for organisations to determine whether attackers have penetrated their systems, stolen any data or installed backdoors. sean koessel, from the cyber-security company volexity, warned companies: "don't leave any stone unturned." "i could easily see it taking half a year or more to figure out, if not into the years, for some of these organisations," he told the reuters news agency. the identities of those responsible for the attacks on orion remain unclear.  however, several us government officials and security experts have pointed the finger at russia for being behind the more devastating "sunburst" attack. the kremlin has denied responsibility.  us national security adviser robert o'brien told fox news: "it's clearly a sophisticated intelligence operation and no doubt was done by a state actor. and we'll get around to attribution of that at a time and place of our choosing." crowdstrike - a leading us cyber-security firm - has said that it believes those responsible for the sunburst hack also tried to breach its systems earlier this year. the firm said it was alerted to the fact by microsoft on 15 december, although the hackers' attempt had failed. cyber-thieves can reap returns of almost 1,500% when they invest in ransomware, a study suggests. trustwave looked at how much cash typical cybercriminals spend and what their potential profits might be. it estimated it would cost $5,900 (£3,860) to buy a ransomware kit that could return up to $90,000 in one month of operation. experts said people should take precautions and avoid paying up if they get hit. ransomware involves a malicious program infecting a machine, scrambling key files and then demanding the machine's owner pay cash before the data is unscrambled.  according to a report from intel-owned security firm mcafee labs, high-tech extortion schemes nearly doubled in the first three months of 2015. "i was frankly stunned by the figures we got from this," said karl sigler, a threat intelligence specialist at trustwave. he said the company drew its figures from information available on hidden sites on tor and discussion forums available on the wider web. typically, he said, a ransomware scammer needs three separate tools to perpetrate their crimes - malware, an exploit kit and a pool of victims. the service industry surrounding web crime had grown to such an extent, he said, that all these were available to buy online. it had found forums in eastern europe, asia and latin america peddling all three. by spending about $5,900, criminals would get the ransomware malicious code, an online kit that acted as an administration system for an attack campaign and a ready source of victims from a compromised site.  if a criminal infected 10% of the 20,000 visitors to a compromised website each day and only 0.5% of those victims paid the $300 ransom being demanded, then one campaign could net a criminal about $90,000 a month, he said.  "the money is there and the economy is there," he said. "if you lack the morals and ethics it can be easy to get into."  mikko hypponen, chief research officer at f-secure, said the virtual currency bitcoin has been key to the growth of ransomware. "that's what really enabled the ransomware problem to explode," he said. "once the criminals were able to collect their ransom without getting caught, nothing was stopping them." the latest trend was for an affiliate model in which the maker of ransomware sells the code to someone else who then uses it.  the market had become so popular that gangs were now competing against each other fighting for market share. "almost all of them deliver the 'goods'," said mr hypponen. "if you pay, you will get your files back. some even run support forums to help you recover. "this is because they need good online reputation: otherwise nobody would pay," he said. mr hypponen's advice to avoid falling victim was to take backups, ensure software is up-to-date, be suspicious of message attachments and run comprehensive security software. "and," he said, "don't pay money to these clowns unless you absolutely have to." lincolnshire county council's computer systems have been closed for four days after being hit by computer malware demanding a £1m ransom.ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and unscrambles it only if victims pay a fee.the council said it was working with its computer security provider to apply a fix to its systems.phillip norton reports. lincolnshire county council's computer systems have been closed for four days after being hit by computer malware demanding a £1m ransom. ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and only unscrambles it if victims pay a fee. the authority said it was working with its computer security provider to apply a fix to its systems. chief information officer judith hetherington-smith said only a small number of files were affected. she said the authority took action once the malware was identified and shut its systems down. this meant some services were affected, including libraries and online booking systems. mrs hetherington-smith said: "people can only use pens and paper, we've gone back a few years." talking about the attack, she said: "it happened very quickly. once we identified it we shut the network down, but some damage is always done before you get to that point - and some files have been locked by the software. "a lot of the files will be available for us to restore from the back-up." the council is "hopeful" most systems will be back working early next week. it described the ransomware as "the biggest attack" it had ever experienced, adding it was "zero-day malware", meaning it was previously unknown to security experts. the authority said it was "unfortunate to be the first victim", and was confident it had appropriate security measures in place. lincolnshire police have confirmed they are investigating the attack. the information commissioner's office, which is responsible for the enforcement of the data protection act 1998, said it was aware of the incident. update: it later became clear that the demand for a £1m ransom - information provided by the council - was actually for substantially less. this has been covered in a follow-up report. as many as 4,000 apps were infected by the xcodeghost malware used in an attack on apple's app store, security researchers have said. the news came as apple said it was going to make its xcode program - the tool used to build apps for its operating system - easier to download in china, where the problem originated. some chinese firms said slow download speeds behind the great firewall led them to seek locally held, bootlegged versions of xcode that they did not know were infected with malware. apple's marketing boss phil schiller said the firm would offer domestic downloads in china in a bid to speed up downloads and convince people to install only the official software. app developers are not blocked from downloading the official version of xcode. but censorship controls, along with low investment in infrastructure for international connections, make using services based outside china a painful process for some. "in the us it only needs 25 minutes to download. china may take three times as long," mr schiller told sina.cn. the counterfeit versions served malware that infected apps built on them, allowing the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they controlled. the us security firm palo alto networks said it believed the number of infected apps was likely to be "far greater" than the few dozen initially thought. according to fireeye, another security company, the figure could be as high as 4,000. the app store had previously been almost entirely free of malware, and it was unclear how the altered code withstood apple's app approval process, in which developers often wait a week for reviews of updates to their apps. "these reviews are legendary for how particular apple is," said robert walker, founder of mobile dating app cuddli, who worked for microsoft in china. "supposedly, a security review is part of that. but they missed this repeatedly over dozens of different applications. a huge mistake on their part." security consultant graham cluley said: "apple security, for so long priding itself on the tight ship it maintains over apps that get into its app store, has definitely suffered a bloody nose. "however, let's not lose sight of the fact that malware appearing in google's equivalent app store for android is far from rare." apple released advice to developers on checking their versions of xcode, but did not respond to a request for comment. the hyatt hotel chain has posted a global list of hotels hit by malware that was found on its customer payments system last year. the list includes hyatt premises in canada, the us, the uk, jordan, chile and indonesia and involves almost half of its properties. the firm is offering one year's free protection to people who used their cards in one of the compromised hotels. the infection took place between august and december last year. the chicago-based hyatt group has 627 properties in its portfolio. it said 250 hotels, all of which it manages directly, had been infected.  in a statement, hyatt's global president of operations chuck floyd said that "unauthorised access" to payment card information - including the names of cardholders, card numbers and expiry dates - had been detected primarily in restaurants but also at spas, golf shops, parking and some front desks inside the hotel chain. "we encourage you to remain vigilant and to review your payment card account statements closely," he said, adding that cards could now be used "with confidence" inside the hotel chain following the investigation. although he said the company had "worked quickly" with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to address the issue, the infection appeared to have gone unnoticed for about four months. the period of risk for affected customers was between 30 july and 8 december 2015, mr floyd wrote. hyatt has now teamed up with a company called csid, which specialises in identity protection and "fraud restoration" services, to offer one year's free coverage for those whose cards may have been compromised. security expert brian krebs noted on his blog that the hilton, starwood, mandarin oriental, white lodging and the trump collection hotels were all hit by payment information breaches last year. online poker players are being targeted by a computer virus that spies on their virtual cards. the software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim. the sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it. the software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords. the malware targets players of the pokerstars and full tilt poker sites, said robert lipovsky, a security researcher at eset, in a blogpost.  when it infects a machine, the software monitors the pc's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. it then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. screenshots are then sent to the attacker. the images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player id. this, said eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage. "we are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way," wrote mr lipovsky. eset found the windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, pc utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases. eset said the spyware had been active for several months and most victims were in eastern europe, particularly russia and the ukraine. login names and passwords for more than 225,000 apple accounts have been stolen by cyber-thieves in china.  the credentials were found by security firm palo alto networks while investigating suspicious activity on many apple devices. it uncovered a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iphones. the majority of people hit by keyraider are in china but palo alto said iphone owners in 17 other nations had also been caught out.  the theft is believed to be the biggest ever involving apple accounts, said palo alto in a blogpost outlining its findings. user reports of unauthorised payments being made via itunes accounts and of apps being installed unexpectedly alerted palo alto to a potential problem. it found that an attacker had made changes to software used on jailbroken iphones. a jailbroken iphone is one that can run apps that are not sourced from the main apple app store.  the main purpose of the booby-trapped software was to let people get apps and other apple content without paying for them. the malicious version of the code, dubbed keyraider by palo alto, spied on transactions to scoop up login names, passwords and other credentials. the stolen data was sent to a remote server run by the malicious hackers behind keyraider. apple's phones are the third most popular in china behind huawei and xiaomi, suggests research.  security firm symantec said iphone-owners were taking a risk by jailbreaking their device because this can remove the security checks apple introduced to thwart malicious apps. "third-party app stores often don't have the same controls and policies in place when it comes to the software they distribute," it said "and may be used to harbour malicious copies of well-known apps or other malware." hundreds of thousands of android phones have been infected with malware that uses handsets to send spam and buy event tickets in bulk. mobile security firm lookout said the virus, called notcompatible, was the most sophisticated it had seen. the cyberthieves behind it had recently rewritten its core code to make it harder to defeat, it said.  mobile malware aimed at smartphones is steadily getting more complex, said security company wandera. jeremy linden, a security analyst at lookout, said: "the group behind notcompatible are operating on a different plane to the typical mobile malware maker."  usually, he said, mobile malware campaigns lasted only a couple of weeks but the notcompatible creators had been operating for more than two years. the bug first appeared in 2012 and was now on its third iteration, he said, adding that the latest version had been rewritten recently and was now as sophisticated as the malware aimed at desktop computers. "they are successful enough to make it worth ripping out the back end of the malware to make it be much more stable and resistant to efforts to take it down," he said. this latest version employed end-to-end encryption, peer-to-peer networking technologies and stealthy operating procedures to help it avoid being spotted and removed, he said. phones infected with notcompatible were enrolled into a network that is now being rented out to any crime group that needs a ready source of android users. mr linden said compromised phones had been used in a variety of scams including sending spam, attacking wordpress blogs and buying tickets for popular events in bulk that would then be resold at a significant profit.  "this is the most technically sophisticated threat we are facing and it's the most worrying to us," said mr linden.  notcompatible is being spread via spam and websites seeded with booby-trapped downloads, he said and urged android users to be wary of any app that required a security update to be installed before it was run. mobile malware was growing in popularity among cybercrime groups because smartphones were now so central to modern life, said eldar tuvey from mobile security monitoring firm wandera "we're definitely seeing the bad guys focus their attention on mobiles," he said. "that's because more time is now spent on apps on phones than desktops." while android had long been a target of malware makers, the appearance of the wirelurker and masque malware families that both targeted apple gadgets showed the growing confidence of cybercriminals, he said. they were keen to get a foothold on a phone so they could harvest useful data that they could sell or use to make phishing emails look more plausible, or to lever open accounts for social networks or other web-based services. with 70% of people reusing passwords across many different sites and services, it was no surprise that criminals regularly got access to these accounts, he said. many were aided by "leaky" apps that passed around log-in names, email addresses and other credentials in unencrypted text, said mr tuvey. "the trend is only moving in one direction," he said. "the criminals are sharing information between themselves and they are learning about how to improve the efficiency of their attacks." malicious software spread via chat forums on the video games streaming site twitch can spend users' money without authorisation, it has emerged. the finnish security firm f-secure said clicking on the malware links also enabled infiltrators to wipe accounts on the gaming shop, steam. twitch is advising users not to use links from unknown sources. the site, which was recently bought by amazon for $970m (£597m) has more than 55 million unique monthly viewers. the vulnerability originates from an automated account which, according to f-secure, "bombards channels and invites viewers to participate in a weekly raffle for a chance to win things such as 'counter-strike: global offensive' items". if viewers take the bait, they are invited to fill in their name and email address which then allows the malicious software to gain control, allowing it to: take screenshotsadd new friends in steam (a gaming shop and community commonly linked to twitch accounts)accept pending friend requests in steaminitiate trading with new friends in steambuy items, if user has moneysend a trade offeraccept pending trade transactions a spokesman for twitch told the bbc that the vulnerability was the "first instance" he had seen, but that the site would "remind our community about not clicking on links from unknown sources just like they wouldn't on other social media sites".  he added: "please note that we give all broadcasters the option to disable links in their chat which can easily prevent this." update: on saturday, a spokesman said twitch had only received two reports of the malware attack, and had blocked the link. if someone shares a porn video on facebook, beware. the latest threat to users involves a fake flash player update which pops up during a preview of a pornographic video. once you click on the link to update your video player, malware (the name given to malicious software), downloads onto your computer.  this trojan horse software gives the creator of the malware remote access to your computer.  they can then download viruses onto your computer.  security researcher mohammad faghani alerted users to the threat in a post on the full disclosure blog, which flags up network vulnerabilities. "the trojan tags the infected user's friends with an enticing post," he explained.  faghani warned that the malware then tags up to 20 friends of the victim in the malicious post, thus leading to a larger number of those who could be affected. he believes it could "infect more than 110,000 users in two days". faghani also said the malware was able to hijack keyboard and mouse movement. in response, facebook said it was aware of the problem and was working to block it. in a statement issued to security news website threatpost, a facebook spokesperson said: "we use a number of automated systems to identify potentially harmful links and stop them from spreading. "in this case, we're aware of these malware varieties, which are typically hosted as browser extensions and distributed using links on social media sites.  "we are blocking links to these scams, offering cleanup options, and pursuing additional measures to ensure that people continue to have a safe experience on facebook." last week, a hacker group called lizard squad had hinted it was responsible for the facebook, instagram and tinder going down. facebook denied it was hacked, saying the access issues were "not the result of a third party attack". follow @bbcnewsbeat on twitter, bbcnewsbeat on instagram and radio1newsbeat on youtube readers of the daily mail's website were shown fake advertisements that linked to malware, according to a security company. it said bogus ads for shoes briefly appeared among the selection of banners displayed on dailymail.com. instead of online shops, it said, the ads linked to malware that could expose computers to "ransomware". ransomware encrypts files on a victim's computer and asks for a payment to decrypt them again. the practice is known as "malvertising". security company malwarebytes said it had made the discovery last week and had published a report about its findings online. a spokesman for the daily mail later said that it had not been contacted by malwarebytes about its findings in advance. however, the bbc has seen evidence that the security company did in fact try to contact the newspaper about the issue last friday. by monday morning, the security company said that the fake ads had been removed. malwarebytes said the banners, purporting to be for an online shoe retailer, were published via a bogus ad server. from there, they were said to have been distributed via an advertising network that presents ads to readers on the daily mail's website. if a user clicked on one of the ads, said the security firm, they would be redirected to a well known piece of malware called the angler exploit kit, which attacks vulnerabilities in internet explorer and flash. there are various ways to protect yourself from ransomware, according to tony berning, senior manager at software company opswat. "to protect against ransomware, users must back up their data regularly," he said. "in addition to this, an important defence against ransomware is the use of anti-virus engines to scan for threats.  "with over 450,000 new threats emerging daily, anti-malware engines need to detect new threats continuously, and will inevitably address different threats at different times," mr berning said. security firm malwarebytes says a campaign of malware hidden inside online ads which hit search engine yahoo earlier this year has now also appeared on adult websites. the advertising, apparently for a service called sex messenger, also contained tools for identifying whether the user was genuine rather than a bot. it appeared on porn site xhamster, one of the world's most visited domains. however the firm said porn sites are no more dangerous than mainstream ones. the ad has now been removed. the malware, which also made use of the security of cloud-based platforms to hide what it was doing, worked by directing the user to a fraudulent page once it had determined that they were running microsoft's internet explorer and had identified the device's security settings. so-called "malvertising" often installs ransomware on to a victim's machine. it loads a page containing false accusations of criminal activity and instructions for paying a fine. "these efforts ensure that only real users will get to see the exploit kit landing page therefore excluding honeypots and security researchers alike," wrote malwarebytes security consultant jerome segura in a blog post. although in this case the ad was popping up so often that researchers were able to study it after all. xhamster is currently ranked the 71st most visited website in the world by web analytics firm alexa and attracts hundreds of millions of monthly users.  but the online porn industry does invest in security, mr segura added. "there's this idea that adult sites are more dangerous to visit than 'regular' sites," he told tech week europe.  "i don't believe it's entirely true especially for the top sites because they do dedicate a lot of resources to fighting fraud and malware.  "based on what we have seen in the past months as far as malvertising goes, we have seen just as many top mainstream publishers as pornographic ones." the firm that distributed the ad has now taken it down. a cybersecurity threat known as shylock has been disrupted thanks to an international operation, the uk's national crime agency (nca) has said. shylock was said to have been installed on more than 30,000 machines worldwide, but mostly targeted bank accounts of people living in the uk. as ever, the nca urged the public to make sure their security software was fully up-to-date. the action follows a similar effort led by us authorities last month. the zeus botnet was said to have infected more than a million computers worldwide.  the us is seeking a russian man, evgeniy bogachev, in connection with the operation. this latest action has been led by uk intelligence services, working in conjunction with security experts based in the hague. "the nca is co-ordinating an international response to a cybercrime threat to businesses and individuals around the world," said andy archibald, deputy director of the nca's national cyber crime unit.  "this phase of activity is intended to have a significant effect on the shylock infrastructure and demonstrates how we are using partnerships across sectors and across national boundaries to cut cybercrime impacting the uk." the shylock malware - so named because passages from shakespeare's the merchant of venice were found within its code - affected computers running microsoft's windows operating system. authorities were able to seize computer servers that were controlling shylock. however, cybercriminals are often quick to react when disrupted by server seizures. in the case of zeus, authorities predicted it would take just two weeks for criminals to reorganise themselves and restart the operation. shapeshifting malware that changes its identity up to 19 times a day to avoid detection has been deactivated by europe's cybercrime centre and the fbi.  at its height in september 2014 the malware, called beebone, was controlling 100,000 computers a day. criminals used it to help steal passwords and download other programs to the infected computers.   around 12,000 victims are being asked to use new online clean-up tools to remove it.    once on a victim's computer, beebone operates like a downloader application that can be controlled by the suspected criminal gangs behind the program.  it was used to force victims' pcs to fetch other malware from the internet including password stealers, ransomware, rootkits, and programs designed to take down legitimate websites.  computer security firm intel security, which helped law enforcement agencies to stop the malware, said it had seen beebone change its identity up to 19 times per day to avoid more traditional "signature detection" anti-virus methods.  intel security's chief technology officer raj samani told the bbc: "beebone is highly sophisticated. it regularly changes its unique identifier, downloading a new version of itself, and can detect when it is being isolated, studied, or attacked.  "it can successfully block attempts to kill it."    operation beebone was carried out by the joint cybercrime action taskforce set up by the european union to tackle cross-border internet crime. the team finally managed to tackle the malware by stopping it from connecting to servers on the net used to control and send it instructions.  nearly 100 .com, .net, and .org domains have been "sinkholed" - the process by which traffic meant for specific ip addresses is redirected from suspected criminal-controlled sites to the investigating authorities. this allows detectives to "see" how the application behaves and to intercept requests for further instructions by the malicious software.   the fbi assisted in redirecting traffic from most of the sites being used by the gangs because they were operated from the united states and are under us jurisdiction.  the operation also involved private security firms intel security, kaspersky labs and shadowserver. the taskforce now believes it has isolated the morphing malware so criminals can no longer make use of it. head of operations at the european cybercrime centre, paul gillen told the bbc the agency would now look at whether those behind the attacks could be identified and brought to justice. he admitted the solution the taskforce had found was not a permanent one: "we can't sinkhole these domains forever. we need those infected to clean up their computers as soon as possible." several security vendors have created a free tool to remove the beebone malware including f-secure, trendmicro, symantec and intel security. but victims need to first realise they have the malware on their systems before they can download the removal tool.  raj samani said those who have the malware "will be notified by their internet service provider".  isps in each affected country will be handed a list of suspected victims to contact by the taskforce.   the beebone malware was described by the europol taskforce as "very sophisticated". some security experts believe the consequences of the attack could have been much worse.    portcullis security in the uk advises various british government departments on cybersecurity issues. its director, paul docherty, told the bbc:  "the fact that it [the malware] is complicated suggests that it could be used for more targeted attacks. if those responsible were able to harness similar difficult-to-detect code they could potentially move the point of attack from home users to corporate users or other entities which typically hold large amounts of sensitive, valuable data." mr docherty said computer users should have anti-virus software installed and that it was essential that they kept it up-to-date. he warned against members of the  public underestimating how valuable their computer might be to criminal hackers.  "there is still a general consensus that, it won't happen to me, i have nothing anyone could want. however, when you discuss with people what they actually use their technology for this changes very quickly."  the total number of computers infected by beebone is relatively modest compared with some recent malware take-downs like gameover zeus. security experts believe this is because the malware was not spread by mass emailing potential victims with poisoned internet links, an approach known as spearphishing. intel security said beebone  was more commonly spread through hardware like usb drives, or data discs.     now remaining victims are being asked to clean up their computers as soon as possible.  mr samani said it is likely those who have beebone on their computers "were likely to have a lot of other malware too because of the nature of beebone as a malware downloader itself".  but there is another good reason why victims will want to move on quickly, says mr docherty: "clean-up after infection could be complicated, as this [criminal] campaign has used a constantly changing (polymorphic) dropper to implant malware, it is possible that it has also installed code of a similar nature to re-enable access to the systems following clean-up." criminal organisations are offering subscription services to other fraudsters to teach them a scam in which they impersonate their victims. fraud prevention organisation cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money. cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at christmas, have tripled this year. criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name. the so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.  criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers. cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. this is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines. criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again. there were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from january to september recorded by cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019. there was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones. cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.  beware christmas parcel delivery scams, banks warnbanks 'too often blaming customers' for fraud mike haley, chief executive of cifas, said: "we often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so i would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police." last month, banking trade body uk finance warned criminals were using the cover of christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. these messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses. the take five to stop fraud campaign is urging people to: stop: taking a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information could keep you safechallenge: could it be fake? it is ok to reject, refuse or ignore any requests. only criminals will try to rush or panic youprotect: contact your bank immediately if you think you've fallen for a scam and report it to action fraud malware has bypassed apple's safety controls by taking advantage of a process used by employers to add apps to workers' iphones and ipads. us-based palo alto networks said wirelurker appeared to have originated in china and was mostly infecting devices there. the malware first targets mac computers via a third-party store before copying itself to ios devices. researchers warn it steals information and can install other damaging apps. "wirelurker is unlike anything we've ever seen in terms of apple ios and os x malware," said ryan olson, palo alto network's intelligence director.  "the techniques in use suggest that bad actors are getting more sophisticated when it comes to exploiting some of the world's best-known desktop and mobile platforms."  wirelurker has the ability to transfer from apple's mac computer to mobile devices through a usb cable.  the security firm said the malware was capable of stealing "a variety of information" from mobile devices it infects and regularly requested updates from the attackers' control server. "this malware is under active development and its creator's ultimate goal is not yet clear," the company added. apple has issued a brief statement. "we are aware of malicious software available from a download site aimed at users in china, and we've blocked the identified apps to prevent them from launching," it said. "as always, we recommend that users download and install software from trusted sources." according to palo alto networks, wirelurker was first noticed in june when a developer at the chinese firm tencent realised there were suspicious files and processes happening on his mac and iphone. further inquiries revealed a total of 467 mac programs listed on the maiyadi app store had been compromised to include the malware, which in turn had been downloaded 356,104 times as of 16 oct. infected software included popular games including angry birds, the sims 3, pro evolution soccer 2014 and battlefield: bad company 2. once the malware was on the mac, it communicated with a command-and-control server to check if it needed to update its code, and then waited until an iphone, ipad or ipod was connected. when an ios device was connected the malware would check if it was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove some of apple's restrictions. if it was jailbroken, wirelurker backed up the device's apps to the mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the ios machine. if it was not jailbroken - which is the case for most ios devices - wirelurker took advantage of a technique created by apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets.  this involved placing infected apps on the device that had been signed with a bogus "enterprise certificate" - code added to a product that is supposed to prove it comes from a trustworthy source.  to ensure the devices accepted this certificate, a permissions request was made to pop up on the targeted ios device on the user's first attempt to run an infected app.  it simply asked for permission to run the app, but if the user clicked "continue" it installed code called a "provisioning profile", which told the ios device it could trust any other app that had the same enterprise certificate. palo alto networks remarked that while this technique was not a new concept, it was the only known example of it being used to target non-jailbroken ios devices in the wild. once active, the malware is used to upload information about the machine to the hackers, including phone numbers from its contacts app, and the user's apple id. different versions of wirelurker also automatically installed new apps on the devices - including a video game and a comic book reader. while these were innocuous, experts warn they could represent a test run for other more damaging software. "people have got very used to ios being secure and there is a danger they may be complacent about the risk this presents," said prof alan woodward, from the university of surrey. "now apple knows what it's looking for, it should be able to shut it down relatively easily. but it shows that people are trying to attack apple's operating system and the firm can't take security for granted."  news of the attack comes after tech giant apple's icloud storage service in china was attacked by hackers trying to steal user information just last month. chinese web monitoring group greatfire.org said that hackers intercepted data and potentially gained access to passwords, messages, photos and contacts. they believed the beijing government was behind the move. but the chinese government denied the claims and was backed by state-owned internet provider china telecom, which said the accusation was "untrue and unfounded". china is home to the world's biggest smartphone market and apple saw its iphone sales there jump 50% in the april to june quarter from a year earlier. to minimise the risk of attack, palo alto networks has recommended that users: do not download mac apps from third-party storesdo not jailbreak ios devicesdo not connect their ios devices to untrusted computers and accessories, either to copy information or charge the machinesdo not accept requests for a new "enterprise provisioning profile" unless it comes from an authorised party, for example the employer's it department new malware targeting apple products is mostly affecting chinese users, warned an online security researcher.us-based palo alto networks said "wirelurker" which is infecting apple's desktop and mobile operating systems appears to have originated in china and is mostly infecting devices there.the malware spreads through apps uploaded from a third-party store and can steal information.the bbc's john sudworth in beijing explained how products are being affected.   an antivirus program labelled itself as malware, causing some computers it was running on to stop working. after an update, essential components in two panda security antivirus programs became corrupted, leading them to be mistakenly identified as malign and quarantined. panda said a fix had been released and warned that rebooting affected systems could exacerbate the issue. it asked those affected to get in touch so it could help fix their machines. one security expert noted the irony. "people's first response is to turn [their computer] off and back on again, but in this case it seems like the wrong thing to do," said prof alan woodward, of surrey university. the "last thing" people would expect to cause their computers to break down was its security software, he said. panda security said that the signature file in both its pcop and its retail 2015 packages became corrupted. "the signature file was repaired immediately. additionally, a solution for all affected products has been automatically deployed. however, in certain environments it is possible for the incident to persist." it added a list of steps that affected users could take to ensure that their system was clear of the issue. prof woodward said the episode was "not a great advert for panda". he said he had heard of some companies losing the use of multiple computers to the issue. he added that data loss was a risk if machines were rebooted. but panda security said it was helping people whose machines had stopped working to restore them and that it had no evidence anyone had experienced permanent data loss as a result of the issue. a panda security spokeswoman said: "we have solved 90% of the incidents, and support is being given in real time to the ones that still have some issues." the company said that only 8% of the "millions" of pcop and retail 2015 customers were affected by the issue. a spokeswoman refused to be more precise about the figures. a danish security company has detected an attempt to spread a powerful form of android malware via text messages. mazar can gain administrator rights on phones, allowing it to wipe handsets, make calls or read texts. however, it will not install on phones where the language is set to russian. additionally, users would have to have unchecked a default setting on android devices that ensures software may only be installed from trusted sources. security firm heimdal thinks the malicious texts could have been sent to over 100,000 phones in denmark, though it is not sure whether users in other countries may have received the messages. this is believed to be the first time mazar has been detected in widespread, real world attacks. in the examples studied by heimdal, users receive an innocuous-looking text providing a link to what looks like a multimedia message. this link downloads tor software, which enables anonymous internet connections, to the phone. afterwards, the malware itself is downloaded through tor in an apparent effort to hide the source of the malicious software itself. one interesting feature of mazar is that it cannot be installed on smartphones running android with "russian" selected as the operating system's language. similar controls have been detected in pc malware in the past, according to morten kjaersgaard, chief executive of heimdal. infected phones are at risk from a range of threats - from attackers secretly monitoring devices to reading a user's texts or even erasing all personal data from the handset. or, the attacker could simply send a lot of texts to premium numbers. "it can do a lot of damage - maybe running up a big phone bill for which the customer would be liable," mr kjaersgaard told the bbc. "it's not like when you use your credit card and there's an international standard for banks covering [fraud]." heimdal tested phones running android kitkat (version 4.4) but mr kjaersgaard believes the issue is likely to affect all prior versions as well. later versions of the operating system have not been tested. the advice to users is to never tap on web links in text messages from unfamiliar phone numbers and to be cautious of links even if the message appears to be from a known contact since sometimes this can be spoofed. "over one billion devices are protected with google play which conducts 200 million security scans of devices per day," a google spokeswoman said. "fewer than 1% of android devices had a potentially harmful app installed in 2014, and fewer than 0.15% of devices that only install from google play had a potentially harmful app installed," she added. a leeds-based hacker used a notorious piece of malware called blackshades to spy on people via their webcams. investigators from the national crime agency found images on the computer of stefan rigo, 34, including ones of people involved in sexual activity, some of whom were on skype at the time. rigo was arrested in november last year during an international investigation. he has been given a 20-week suspended sentence and placed on the sex offenders' register for seven years. rigo targeted a variety of victims after gaining remote access to their computers' webcams.  incriminating images on his computer were discovered after a forensic examination. out of 14 confirmed individuals he spied on - roughly half were people he knew personally, an nca spokesman told the bbc. at a hearing in july, rigo pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism and another computer-related offence. the court took rigo's guilty plea into account when handing down the 20 week sentence. as well as being placed on the sex offenders register, rigo will have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work within the next 12 months. investigators found and arrested rigo after raiding two addresses in leeds. the hacker had used his ex-girlfriend's details to purchase blackshades, a remote access trojan (rat) which allows for a high level of surreptitious control over a victim's computer.  "the problem with rats specifically is a lot of the time people don't know they're being affected," the nca spokesman said. "in the case of stefan rigo that we were looking at, his victims weren't aware." blackshades has been around since 2010 and has been sold for as little as $40 (£26), explained jens monrad at cyber security firm fireeye. "the application in itself is not that difficult to detect but typically the attackers will wrap some sort of exploit around the application," said mr monrad. "even with patches the victim will still be vulnerable so long as there is a hole in the operating system." mr monrad recommended that computer users be careful of clicking on suspicious links or downloading dubious email attachments. the criminal market for webcam hacking tools is highly active, according to mr monrad, since malicious hackers are often able to exploit their victims after taking covert images of them.  there have also been cases in which hackers sold access to specific cameras. connected security cameras in buildings may be at risk too, though there are sometimes difficulties in publicly discussing how secure they are. one researcher recently cancelled a forthcoming talk on the issue following legal pressure from the manufacturers of widely-used surveillance cameras. gianni gnesa was due to discuss "vulnerabilities found on major surveillance cameras and show how an attacker could used them to stay undetected" at the hitb gsec security conference in singapore. the register reports that a legal threat from one, unnamed, manufacturer resulted in gnesa withdrawing his presentation.  apple has said it is taking steps to remove malicious code added to a number of apps commonly used on iphones and ipads in china. it is thought to be the first large-scale attack on apple's app store. the hackers created a counterfeit version of apple's software for building ios apps, which they persuaded developers to download.  apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. cybersecurity firm palo alto networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed xcodeghost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. it added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. infected applications includes tencent's hugely popular wechat app, netease's music downloading app and didi kuaidi's uber-like car hailing app.  some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner camcard - are also available outside china. "we've removed the apps from the app store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software," said apple spokeswoman christine monaghan. "we are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of xcode to rebuild their apps," said christine monaghan.  on its official wechat blog, tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - wechat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. it added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. in apple's walled garden app store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen.  the company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security.  the apple app store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on ios apps, compared to google's play store which for a while was regarded as something of a "wild west" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). it makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out.  firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied.   and secondly, apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat.  follow dave lee on twitter @daveleebbc the malware was initially flagged by researchers at the chinese e-commerce firm alibaba. it discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of xcode - a tool used to build ios apps - to a chinese cloud storage service. then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by chinese developers. "in china - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from apple's servers," explained palo alto networks in a follow-up blog. "as the standard xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources." it added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. apple does have a security tool - called gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised mac programs and stop them from being run. however, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create ios apps with xcodeghost. despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of apple products. "it is definitely embarrassing for apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of pcs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020," wee teck loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm euromonitor international, told the bbc. in fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on pcs, he added. "in emerging markets like china or vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted," he said. "consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues." earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in china. it was uncovered by security firm palo alto networks while investigating suspicious activity on many apple devices. it found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iphones. the majority of people affected were in china. adverts on websites are now the biggest source of malware on mobile phones, according to a study. research by security company blue coat suggests web adverts have overtaken pornography as the most common way for users to encounter a malware threat. on one in five occasions when a mobile user comes into contact with malware, it is via an online advert. mobile malware is growing, but accounts for just 1% of all malware threats, networking company cisco says. although web adverts have replaced pornography as the most common way for users to encounter malware, attacks from x-rated sites are still the most effective. less than 1% of all requested content on a mobile is for pornography, yet it is responsible for 16% of malware attacks. "while users don't access pornography that frequently, when they do, they are very vulnerable to malware," said the report. in comparison, blue coat say, adverts make up 12% of requested content but are responsible for nearly 20% of attacks. the adverts are often displayed through "legitimate ad networks" but contain "malicious code" or direct users to "malicious sites". the report states that the threat of malware from web ads has increased almost three times since it last looked at data relating to the trend in 2012. cisco's 2014 annual security report noted that although mobile malware was "not a significant percentage" of web malware encounters "it is still worth noting because mobile malware is clearly an emerging area of exploration for malware developers". it also found that when mobile malware is intended to compromise a device, it is nearly always targeted at android devices. but when mobile malware is not specifically designed to target certain types of devices, then 70% of the attacks were experienced by android devices and 14% by apple iphone users. blue coat recommended that mobile users considered blocking web ads on their devices to prevent them becoming victims of a malware attack. ad-blocking apps exist for both android and apple devices and browser settings can be adjusted to prevent ad pop-ups. millions of java users are to be warned that they could be exposed to malware as a result of a flaw that existed in the software's update tool. the plug-in is installed on many pcs to let them to run small programs written in the java programming language. its distributor oracle has agreed to issue an alert on both social media and its own site following an investigation by the us's federal trade commission. by doing so it has avoided the risk of being fined. however, the firm has not formally admitted to any wrongdoing. according to the ftc's complaint, oracle was aware of security issues in the java se (standard edition) plug-in when it bought the technology's creator sun in 2010. "the security issues allowed hackers to craft malware that could allow access to consumers' usernames and passwords for financial accounts, and allow hackers to acquire other sensitive information," the ftc said.  the regulator alleged that oracle had promised consumers that installing its updates would ensure their pcs would be "safe and secure". but it said the firm had failed to acknowledge that a risk remained. this was because sun's original update process did not delete earlier versions of its software, which hackers could exploit to carry out their attacks. when oracle initially tried to address this, its update tool only removed the most recent prior version of java, leaving earlier editions behind. it was not until august 2014 that the company finally rectified the problem. oracle could not plead ignorance because the ftc had obtained internal documents dated from 2011 that stated "[the] java update mechanism is not aggressive enough or simply not working". according to the watchdog, java se is installed on more than 850 million computers.  because many of those will still not have installed the latest versions of the plug-in, the warning still serves a purpose and provides a link that can be used to detect and uninstall the code. java is still used to power some web browser-based games, calculator, chat tools and other functions. however, one expert said most users should take this opportunity to trash it. "java is one of the top three applications that criminals target," commented rik ferguson, vice president of security research at anti-malware firm trend micro. "it comes pre-installed on a lot of machines, so a lot of people don't know they are using it. "there are times in some businesses where they may be internal applications that require java in the web browser, so you won't have much option, but our recommendation for others is to remove it and stop using it." mr ferguson added that the ruling sent out a message to other software providers that the ftc was concerned about update procedures and might not settle future cases without imposing a financial penalty. researchers from an american security company have unearthed a substantial malware-based fraud ring. the operation has infiltrated one of brazil's most popular payment methods, boleto, for two years. an estimated 495,753 boleto transactions have been compromised, which means the hackers could have stolen up to $3.75bn (£2.18bn). researchers say it is not known whether the fraudsters were successful in collecting on all of the transactions. boleto bancario allows an individual to pay an exact amount to a merchant and can be used for almost every kind of transaction, from the weekly shop to phone bills. boletos can be used and generated both online for electric transfers and offline with printed paper. the attack has been described by us-based security company rsa, a division of data storage corporation emc, as "a major fraud operation and a serious cybercrime threat to banks, merchants and banking customers in brazil". it is not clear how much has been stolen or whether all the funds were successfully redirected to fraudster-controlled bank accounts. however, this will have been the largest electronic theft in history if even half of the valued worth turns out to be in the hands of criminals, according to the new york times. the number of infected pcs totals 192,227 - an additional 83,506 email user credentials have also been stolen. known colloquially as a man-in-the-browser threat, the malware silently injects itself into users' web browsers after hackers have initially tricked individuals into clicking malicious links in seemingly ordinary looking emails. this is similar in principle to phishing scams. once the malware is in the browser, fraudsters can begin to intercept and alter boleto details. this activity is invisible to the user. "because of its stealth capabilities, end-users also have little chance of detecting boleto fraud on their own," said rsa researchers. google's chrome, mozilla's firefox and microsoft's internet explorer are all vulnerable to the attack. "brazil has long been a hotbed of cybercrime, and although we don't know exactly what financial impact may have been caused by this sophisticated attack it's possible that different factors might have helped the hackers get away with it," said computer security analyst graham cluley. "sadly brazilian computers aren't always necessarily running the very latest anti-virus software, and because boletos aren't used outside of brazil it might have made security companies less vigilant about the threat." boletos are the second most popular payment method in brazil, responsible for an estimated 18% of all purchases during 2012. "such attacks will have a serious impact on the confidence we place in increasingly common digital payment methods," warned dr andrew rogoyski, chair of techuk cyber-security group. mr cluley advises users to "be cautious about opening unsolicited email attachments or clicking on unknown links, and keep your computer updated with security patches and the latest anti-virus". three people have been arrested in china on suspicion of spreading malware that targeted apple's operating system, chinese officials have announced. the beijing bureau of public security announced the arrest of suspects charged with spreading the wirelurker malware. the bug was one of the first pieces of malware to penetrate iphone's strict software controls. it mainly infected devices in china. the suspects - named only as chen, lee and wang - were arrested in the beijing area,  according to the statement posted on chinese social network sina weibo. the chinese authorities also shut down the site that had been spreading the malware. the malware was installed via software downloaded to mac desktops from the maiyadi app store. it was then able to attack ios devices connected to an infected mac via a usb cable. if a handset was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove apple's restrictions - wirelurker backed up the device's apps to the mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the ios machine. but, according to security experts, the malware was also able to infect non-jailbroken ios devices. it did so by taking advantage of a technique created by apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets. this process has since been changed by apple. by the time wirelurker had been discovered, infected mac apps had already been downloaded more than 300,000 times. apple took steps to block the infected apps and reminded users not to install software from third-party app stores. a windows version of the malware was also found. british police have arrested a 28-year-old man following an international series of raids over smartphone malware called droidjack. the uk's national crime agency (nca) confirmed the arrest after it was reported that raids took place in five european countries and the us. droidjack allows criminals to spy on smartphone data traffic, eavesdrop on conversations and hijack the camera. no further arrests have yet been reported. "i can confirm that the nca arrested a 28-year-old male from carlisle under suspicion of computer misuse act offences," an nca spokesman told the bbc. the spokesman said the arrest was made in connection with the international droidjack operation and added that the suspect has been bailed for six months. officers in the uk, germany, france, belgium and switzerland raided several properties connected to suspected users of malware known as droidjack. the searches were reported by the afp and reuters news agencies while europol also say that raids were conducted in the united states. a total of 13 homes were raided in germany according to the local prosecutor's office, while news agencies also reported a single raid in switzerland.  the german suspects were aged between 19 and 51.  droidjack is a remote access trojan or "rat", which is openly sold online for $210 (£137), and affects android devices only. "it can track a user's every move without their knowledge," explained peter coogan, principal security response manager at symantec. "there was a documented case back in 2014, i think, where it was being sent out via spam email and pretending to be a bank. it is likely at that time that they were trying to steal banking details off the phone," he told the bbc. mr coogan added that he has tracked discussion of the malware on underground hacking forums where droidjack has been marketed. "more people will have purchased it and are probably using it," he said. seventeen men have been arrested in the uk as part of a worldwide crackdown on a malicious computer program.  the fbi-co-ordinated operation targeted blackshades software which can remotely control computers and webcams. the "malware" was said to have infected more than 500,000 computers since 2010. the uk's national crime agency said 15 arrests took place in england and two men were held in scotland. eighty others were held in 15 countries including the us, france and germany. the nca said the inquiry focused on the developers and "prolific users" of blackshades. it said investigators believe about 200,000 usernames and passwords of victims across the world may have been taken by uk users of blackshades.  the software typically infects computers when people click on external links on social networking sites and in emails that purport to lead to pictures, videos or other items of interest, said the nca. once installed, criminals can use the software to capture personal information, or take photographs of computer users - which may be used to blackmail them. blackshades also allows users to take control of a computer secretly and encrypt its data, which is only released on payment of a ransom.  the worldwide operation is reported to have come after the fbi arrested two blackshades developers and obtained a list of the malware's customers. the software was advertised on forums for computer hackers and copies were available for sale for about $40 (£23) each on a website maintained by blackshades, us officials said. the fbi said blackshades has been bought by several thousand people since it was created in 2010, generating sales of more than $350,000 (£208,000).  us officials said more than 500,000 computers in more than 100 countries had been infected by blackshades.  security experts have also linked the program to attacks on syrian dissidents in 2012 and attempts to steal data from more than a dozen french organisations.  details of the raids were outlined at a press conference by preet bharara, us attorney for the southern district of new york, who announced charges against five men. he described blackshades as a "frightening form of cybercrime" saying the program's capabilities were "sophisticated and its invasiveness breathtaking".  blackshades "enabled anyone anywhere in the world to instantly become a dangerous cyber-criminal able to steal your property and invade your privacy," he said. the malware could also be used to bring down websites and send out "ransom notes" to extort cash after telling a user they had lost control of their  computer, he added. the association of chief police officer's lead on e-crime, deputy chief constable peter goodman, said the operation "sends out a clear message to cyber criminals that we have the technology, capability and expertise to track them down". the nca said its officers were also to warn people who had downloaded the malware but not deployed it that they were now known to the agency.  in total more than 300 properties were searched across the world and 1,000 data storage devices seized. the arrests in the uk took place in derbyshire; birmingham; halesowen; wolverhampton; newcastle-under-lyme; brixham, devon; andover, hampshire; ashford, kent; liverpool; manchester; warrington; london; st andrews; glasgow, and leeds. further arrests abroad took place in moldova, switzerland, the netherlands, belgium, finland, austria, estonia, denmark, canada, chile, croatia and italy.  the end of the trump era has caused a collective but cautious sigh of relief in iran.  some in the gulf region feared that in the dying days of his presidency donald trump might choose to double down on his policy of "maximum pressure" on iran and launch a military strike on its civilian nuclear plants and other targets. reports from washington in november indicated this was one option the us president had looked at, before being talked out of it by his advisers. by contrast, president-elect joe biden has made it clear that he wants the us to rejoin the 2015 nuclear pact with iran, which would mean reversing sanctions and releasing money to tehran in exchange for iran's full compliance. so is iran now safe from attack?  in a word, no. israel remains extremely concerned, not just by iran's civilian nuclear activities but by its prolific programme to develop its arsenal of ballistic missiles.  on thursday, israel's defence minister benny gantz was quoted as saying, in reference to iran's nuclear development programme: "it is clear that israel needs to have a military option on the table. it requires resources and investment and i am working to make that happen." israel, as the islamic republic's declared enemy, sees a nuclear bomb in iranian hands as a threat to its very existence and has urged the world to stop it before it is too late.  iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, but its recent action to increase the enrichment of its uranium - one of a sequence which contravene the 2015 deal - has set alarm bells ringing.  in 1981, israel suspected that iraqi president saddam hussein was looking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.  in operation babylon, it took pre-emptive action by carrying out a successful air raid using its own f15 and f16 jets, destroying iraq's osirak nuclear reactor.  twenty-six years later, in 2007, it did the same to syria in operation outside the box, destroying a secret plutonium reactor in the desert near deir al-zour just before it was activated. but iran is a far harder target, in terms of distance, accessibility and air defences. it is questionable whether israel could carry out a successful air raid without us participation - something a biden administration will be reluctant to do.  conscious of the longstanding threat to its nuclear facilities - from the us, israel and possibly the gulf arab states - iran has invested money and effort in burying some of them deep underground, beneath its mountains.  iran's nuclear industry, while ostensibly civilian, is closely entwined with its military and security infrastructure.  in fact, the iranians have had so long to prepare for an attack that there is now a distinct possibility that their underground facilities are becoming impenetrable. despite this, iran's nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to attack on three fronts. "iran's facilities are not impregnable," says mark fitzpatrick, an associate fellow at the international institute for strategic studies (iiss) and an expert on arms control.  "[the one at] natanz is vulnerable to precise bunker-busting bombing, maybe taking two precise hits: one to dig a crater and the other to burst through it or at least to shake the delicate machines enough to put them out of commission." but iran is a vast country and its nuclear facilities are spread out in depth.  as far back as 2012 experts suggested that the uranium enrichment facility at fordo, buried at least 80m (260ft) inside a mountain, might be impregnable to even the devastating explosive power of us "bunker-busting" precision-guided bombs. "fordo's greater depth protects the facility against bunker-busters, but not against sabotage," says mark fitzpatrick, "and it could be put out of commission for a period of months by blasting its entryways and airshafts". but to reach these facilities would require one, possibly two waves of air strikes penetrating deep into iranian airspace and either evading or overpowering its air defences.  iran has invested heavily in developing its surface-to-air missile force, including the bavar-373 - a homegrown version of russia's s-300 system that is capable of tracking and shooting down aircraft up to 300km (186 miles) away. the prospect of an only partially successful strike, with downed pilots captured and paraded on iranian tv, is a strong disincentive. this has already been happening.  israel's mossad intelligence agency has managed to develop an extraordinarily well-informed network of agents inside iran.  so well-informed that when iran's top military scientist, brig gen mohsen fakhrizadeh, was travelling in a protected convoy on a lonely road east of tehran on 27 november his attackers knew his precise route and timings.  reports differ on how he was attacked on that day. iran claims it was by a remote, satellite-controlled machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck. other sources believe it was by a sizable team of mossad-trained agents, who escaped and remain at large.  either way, fakhrizadeh - known as "the godfather of iran's nuclear programme", who us intelligence says carried out covert work on nuclear weapons - was assassinated.  how will iran respond to nuclear scientist's killing?what were the motives behind the killing?after trump, what will biden do about iran?what is behind mysterious fires at iran sites? israel has not commented officially on who was behind it. before that, between 2010 and 2012, four leading iranian nuclear scientists were all assassinated inside iran, some by car bombs.  again, israel neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. but the killings show that despite heavy protection by iranian state security, assassins are able to reach their targets, setting back iran's intellectual capacity in nuclear technology. there is an undeclared war going on in cyberspace, with iran on one side and the us, israel and saudi arabia ranged against it. in 2010, a sophisticated piece of malware codenamed stuxnet was secretly introduced into the computers controlling iran's uranium-enriching centrifuges at natanz.  the result was chaos, causing the centrifuges to spin out of control and setting the enrichment programme back by years.  the cyber attack was widely reported to have been israeli, although us and israeli experts are believed to have collaborated on developing stuxnet.  iran soon hit back, successfully inserting its own sophisticated malware codenamed shamoon into the network of saudi arabia's state-owned oil company, saudi aramco, disabling 30,000 computers and threatening saudi arabia's oil production.  further attacks have followed. the 2015 nuclear deal - the joint comprehensive plan of action - was supposed to place such stringent curbs on iran's nuclear activities that it would negate the need for its adversaries to consider a military strike. but israel and saudi arabia were always sceptical about the deal because they considered it too lenient and temporary, and because it did nothing to address iran's ballistic missile programme.  today, they are less than enthusiastic about a biden presidency reviving the deal unless it addresses those concerns.   nobody in the gulf region wants to see another conflict. even the 2019 missile attack on saudi arabia's oil infrastructure, widely blamed on iran and its allies, went unanswered.  but as long as suspicions remain that iran is secretly working on developing a nuclear warhead capability, then the risk of a pre-emptive attack on its facilities will always be there. cyber thieves who target android phones are getting more sophisticated, suggests a report. malware makers are tailoring their creations to make the most of conditions in each territory, said the report by mobile security firm lookout. in some places such as russia, android users were far more likely to encounter malicious code, it said.  the report comes as analysis of apps on google's play store shows a steep rise in the number of malicious programs. "when it comes to mobile malware, everything is now regionalised," said marc rogers, lookout's principal security researcher. gone were the days when the hi-tech thieves spammed their creations out to everyone, he said. now malware varied by region as it was adapted to the different conditions in those places.  in europe, wider use of security software on smartphones and action by industry groups against some types of fraudulent activity had forced a reaction from the malware makers. "most of europe is now a hostile environment for premium-rate malware," said mr rogers. "you can do it, but it is very difficult to monetise." instead, he said, europe was seeing a rise in so-called chargeware that tries to trick people into paying for a service or app. pornographic apps were the biggest users of this tactic, he said. similarly, the us had seen less use of premium-rate scams in favour of apps that steal data, such as login information for online banking systems. however, mr rogers said premium-rate malware was still very prevalent in russia where many people got their apps from unofficial sites rather than google's play store, putting the country ahead of the world in terms of the percentage of android users who were likely to encounter malicious apps of all sorts, he said.  the "encounter rate" for the average russian android user was 68%, he said. by contrast, encounter rates in the us and europe were about 4%.  lookout's report, based on stats using feedback from its 50 million users, comes as another security company, riskiq, said it had seen a huge rise in the number of malicious programs appearing on google's play store.  in 2011 about 10,000 of the 400,000 apps on the play store were malicious in one way or another. in 2013 the total number of apps hit one million and riskiq said 42,000 of these could be classed as malicious. apps that helped people personalise their phone were the most likely to be malicious, said riskiq. russian hackers targeted this year's olympic games in tokyo with the aim of disrupting them, uk officials said. the foreign office said russia's gru military intelligence carried out "cyber reconnaissance" against officials and organisations involved. the alleged attacks took place before the games were postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. officials did not, however, specify the nature or extent of the cyber-attacks in detail. at the same time, the us department of justice announced charges against six russian gru officers for alleged cyber-attacks  serving "the strategic benefit of russia". the group sought to disrupt the 2018 winter olympics, the 2017 french presidential election, and ukraine's power grid, us prosecutors said. "no country has weaponised its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as russia," assistant attorney general john demers told a press conference, calling it "the most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group". uk foreign secretary dominic raab said the attacks targeting organisers, sponsors, and logistics providers of the tokyo olympic and paralympic games were "cynical and reckless". "we condemn them in the strongest possible terms," he said. "the uk will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious cyber-attacks." foreign office officials also revealed details of the attack on the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang, south korea. on that occasion, the operation was a "false flag" - one designed to look like it came from north korea or china, they said. the uk and us have been trying to increase the pressure on russian hackers for a number of years by publicly exposing their activity, and they will be hoping that news of moscow targeting an event like the olympics will draw wider support from other countries.  it is thought that this attempt at disruption, like the 2018 attack on the winter olympics, was in response to russia being excluded from sporting events for doping violations. two years ago, some attendees were unable to print tickets for the opening ceremony, leaving empty seats, and this is the first time the uk government has formally attributed that attack to russia. western intelligence officials believe there is some disruption caused by the exposure of moscow's practices and specific techniques, forcing the hackers to adapt.  but there is not much sign that the public campaign is forcing a rethink over their willingness to engage in such activity. the 2018 winter olympics operation is said to have taken aim at the opening ceremony - targeting broadcasters, officials, sponsors, and even a ski resort.  the uk's national cyber security centre, which helped to analyse the information, said the 2018 attack was "intended to sabotage the running of the winter olympic and paralympic games" by disabling its networks. one method was to deploy malware that deleted data from the computer systems used that year. it was prevented by it officials cutting off affected computers and replacing them entirely to prevent the malware from spreading, it said. uk officials have attributed several cyber-attacks against major organisations to gru units operating under various names such as sandworm, voodoobear and iron viking. the foreign office itself was subjected to one such attack in 2018, when gru-affiliated hackers attempted to access its computer systems using a spearphishing attack. an attempt to stop prosecutors using messages from hundreds of phones that were part of the encrochat secret communications network in court has been rejected by the appeal court. judges ruled the messages, obtained by french police by hacking the phones, were not gained by "interception". under british law, evidence from interception cannot be used in court. the national crime agency believes encrochat was mainly used by criminals, often to trade drugs and guns. the judgement will have major implications for cases against suspected organised criminals around the country. due to legal restrictions, it is the first time the bbc can report the detail of arguments surrounding encrochat, which was penetrated by police last summer resulting in more than 1,000 arrests. the nca, which obtained the evidence from france, said it was the biggest breakthrough ever in the fight against organised crime. hundreds arrested as crime chat network crackedhaulier ran europe-wide drug ring from living roomdrugs boss captured as police crack coded messages senior officers described it "as akin to cracking the enigma code". the messages, sent by suspects who did not know they were being monitored, detail alleged drug dealing and murder plots, and include images and videos. many of the cases based on "encro" evidence are now going to court, and if this judgement had ruled the messages couldn't be used, some trials may have been abandoned. under long-standing british law, designed to protect intelligence techniques from scrutiny and make criminal trials manageable, intercepted evidence can't be used in court. in 2016, parliament passed the investigatory powers act in a massive overhaul of surveillance law. the act introduced a "double lock" that requires interception warrants to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge. in a 2015 factsheet on the bill before it became law, the home office defined interception as "making available the content of a communication to someone other than the sender or intended recipient during the course of its transmission. in practice that means listening to a phone call or reading an email". but the lord chief justice, lord burnett of maldon, lord justice edis, and mrs justice whipple dismissed an appeal by lawyers for encrochat defendants. the key legal argument centred on a piece of "malware" placed by french experts on encrochat phones worldwide. it sent copies of every message to a police server. france has refused to say how, what it called "the implant", worked, creating legal uncertainty in british courts. encrochat was a private messaging service that promised its users secure and secretive communications. as well as the encrochat messaging app, the company developed a modified version of the android operating system and sold altered smartphones known as "carbon units" to run its software. switched on by pressing just the power button, the phones would load a "dummy" android homescreen. but activated another way they would boot into encrochat mode. getting hold of an encrochat phone was not cheap, and the subscription charges were more than £200 a month. messages sent between handsets were end-to-end encrypted: scrambled as they travelled across the internet, making them practically impossible to decode if intercepted. but in june 2020, the company warned its users that an attack had comprised its handsets and advised them to "physically dispose of your device immediately". if the implant had collected the messages as they were being transmitted, this would amount to interception of the communications. the defence lawyers claimed the implant was taking messages from the phones' memory, milliseconds before being sent to their wifi or mobile data transmitters and therefore the data was "in transmission". but the judges decided the data was in fact being stored temporarily on the devices as it was processed, before being transmitted. they said this was evident because during the actual transmission the message were encrypted, and therefore couldn't have been read, as they were by the police. the data collected also included crucial username information from the phone's storage memory, which is not sent as part of the transmission. in friday's judgement they compared the process with that of sending a letter: "the process involves the letter being written, put in an envelope, a stamp being attached and then the letter being placed in the post box.   "only the last act involves the letter being transmitted by a system, but all the acts are essential to that transmission." families of those arrested during the fall-out from the encrochat penetration have been arguing online that the nca broke the law by accessing and reading messages "in real time", as they were being sent. they say british law enforcement agencies effectively allowed a foreign power, france, to hack the phones of 9,000 uk encrochat users. police claimed that in general, using an encrochat phone, which cost thousands of pounds to own and operate, demonstrated a likely involvement in criminal activity. but suspects' supporters say innocent family members were caught up in a race to make use of the encro messages, because police feared they would be criticised if they were not seen to take action. however the decision of the appeal court was that the evidence was collected lawfully. jamie oliver's website was affected by a "malware problem", a spokesman for the celebrity chef has acknowledged. malicious code sought to exploit vulnerabilities in users' systems and install malware, researchers found. if installed, that malware could give hackers control of users' computers, said one security consultant. a spokesman for the jamie oliver group played down the seriousness of the problem and told the bbc that it had been fixed. according to malwarebytes, unknown hackers either broke into mr oliver's site and placed malicious code there, or exploited existing code. the script would direct unsuspecting users to a wordpress site that hosted yet more malicious code. that would then run an exploit kit that would seek to find vulnerabilities in any user's system and install malware called dorkbot. online security consultant graham cluley said the hackers could then gain control of a user's system and direct fake searches. "in other words, you may think you're googling but, in fact, you are being redirected against your will to search results that earn the attackers affiliate cash," he told the bbc. "in addition, you may find that you are tricked into installing bogus security updates on your computer or told to ring what is claimed to be technical support - although you would actually be speaking to scammers after your credit card details." according to a spokesman for jamie oliver, only 10 users had written to the site about the issue in the past couple of days. he said that a "low-level malware problem" was identified and dealt with and that the site was now "safe to use". the spokesman added: "the jamie oliver website is regularly checked for vulnerabilities by both our in-house team and an independent third party, and they quickly deal with anything that is found.  "the team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident, but if anyone is worried do please use the contact form on the site. "we apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site." the spokesman confirmed that existing code on the site was modified by a hacker, but said the website team was still trying to work out when that had happened. the celebrity chef's site has 10 million visitors per month and is ranked 515th in britain, according to an analyst. mr cluley said that its sheer popularity made the problem "serious". he said: "users would hope that there was tight security in place on the website to prevent this kind of attack from happening - but it appears that things went badly wrong on this occasion." jerome segura, of malwarebytes, uncovered the issue. he said that, during tests, the malware sought to exploit adobe flash, microsoft silverlight and oracle java. mr cluley advised users to run up-to-date antivirus software and the latest patches to secure applications. he added that users should avoid running their computers with admin privileges, "as this is more attractive for attackers". the us national security agency (nsa) infected 50,000 networks with malware, dutch newspaper nrc has reported. the tailored access operations department used it to steal sensitive information, according to a censored slide leaked by former nsa contractor edward snowden. nrc said 20,000 networks had been hit in 2008, with the program recently expanded to include others in rome, berlin, pristina, kinshasa, rangoon. the nsa declined to comment. the malware could be put in a "sleeper" mode and activated with a click of a button, the paper said. "clearly, conventional criminal gangs aren't the only people interested in breaking into computer networks anymore," wrote computer security expert graham cluley in a blogpost.  "all organisations need to ask themselves the question of whether they could be at risk." the reports come as twitter introduces technology it says will help protect people's messages from unwanted scrutiny.  it  has employed a system known as "forward secrecy" that makes it harder for eavesdroppers to access the keys used to encrypt data passing between twitter's servers and users' phones, tablets and pcs. the website of british tv chef, jamie oliver has been hit for a third time by malware that potentially infects the computers of visitors to the site.  it is the third attack on jamieoliver.com in four months.  the security company that found the exploit, malwarebytes says the attack, which redirects users to malicious software, is similar to the previous two.  a spokesperson for jamie oliver said they were working "to find the issue".   malwarebytes says the problem was caused by a link on the site redirecting users to what appears to be a compromised website that contains links to download the malicious code.  victims without adequate security against such attacks could then find their pcs are compromised with a program running in the background which scans for and steals passwords, sending them on in a report to criminals behind the scam without the users' knowledge. "the team in charge of jamie oliver's website has acknowledged the issue and is taking steps to remediate this problem once and for all," the security company told the bbc.  "obviously no-one in charge of a website likes to see malware come back time and time again. website malware is a different beast to windows-based malware. "the problem is that often people will get rid of the obvious signs (the symptoms)...  but not what caused it in the first place."  "we've implemented daily.. malware detection scans, also an industry leading web application firewall to protect against all common security attacks.. which has been blocking numerous hacking attempts," said a spokesperson for the website.   "we're working with a number of security companies to find the issue once and for all.  we're also running daily manual checks which have detected and cleaned a number of threats although it's important to note that we have had no reports from any users that have been put at risk." malwarebytes said the best way web users could protect themselves from becoming a victim of such attacks was to keep their security software up-to-date.  russian police have reportedly arrested a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools. he is suspected of being the man behind the alias paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the blackhole and cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware. the russian authorities have not confirmed the details. but security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use. a spokesman for the law enforcement agency europol told the bbc: "europol and the european cybercrime centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested.  "we can only refer you to the russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic." the russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time. however, alexander gostev, chief security expert at the moscow-based internet protection provider kaspersky lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by "anonymous sources". the blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to fraser howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company sophos. he said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (£125) for one week's use, among other price plans. the software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the java programming language, adobe's flash media player, windows software and pdf files. it had two ways of doing this: adding malicious code to hundreds of thousands of legitimate websites, which then copied malware to visitors computerscreating links in spam messages to specially created sites that infected pcs among the malware downloaded was: fake anti-virus software that falsely claimed the pc was infected and urged the user to pay a fee to remove virusestrojans that attempted to steal financial records stored on the pcthe zeroaccess rootkit, which downloaded other software that hijacked the pc for use in a botnet - a facility used to overwhelm websites with traffic and force them offlinekey loggers that took a record of what was typed on the pcransomware that attempted to blackmail the pc owner although mr howard said blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including sweet orange and neutrino. according to the researcher, the blackhole and cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by sophos in august, down from 28% the previous year.  the figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added. another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant. "if it's true that the brains behind the blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen," said graham cluley. "however, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code." mikko hypponen, chief research officer at f-secure, agreed. "if indeed it is paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal," he told the bbc. "he was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals. "both blackhole and its successor cool have been very popular.  "users didn't have to be very technical to operate them - there was a manual that came with them - they just had to get them running and be able to break into a high-profile website, or create a new one from scratch, to install something bad on your computer." the us federal bureau of investigation (fbi) has warned that cyber-hackers have used malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the us. a five-page confidential warning was issued to us businesses on monday, according to reuters news agency.  the software would make it impossible to recover any lost data, the fbi said.  the warning follows a confirmation from the fbi that it is investigating last week's hack into sony pictures entertainment's network. sony pictures was forced to shut down its corporate network in the attack and some of its unreleased films have also been leaked online. but the warning from the us authorities did not name any victims that have been targeted. instead, it provided some technical details about the malicious software and advice on how to handle such an attack. there have been accusations that north korea may have been responsible for the attack on sony pictures after the country's government described a film due to be released by the studio on christmas day as an "undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war".  the interview, starring seth rogan and james franco, tells the story of a cia plot to assassinate the north korean leader.  pyongyang has written letters to the un secretary general and president barack obama asking for the film to be blocked, but when asked if it was involved in the cyber-attack on sony, a spokesman only said "wait and see".  sony has not accused north korea of involvement and said it was investigating the source of the hacking. adverts on yahoo's homepage were infected with malware designed to mine the bitcoin virtual currency, according to security experts. yahoo confirmed that for a four-day period in january, malware was served in ads on its homepage. experts estimate that as many as two million european users could have been hit. security firm light cyber said the malware was intended to create a huge network of bitcoin mining machines. "the malware writers put a lot of effort into making it as efficient as possible to utilise the computing power in the best way," light cyber's founder giora engel told the bbc. bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to accumulate the virtual currency with little effort on their part. "generating bitcoins is basically guessing numbers," said amichai shulman, chief technology office of security firm imperva. "the first one to guess the right number gets 25 bitcoins and if you have a large volume of computers guessing in a co-ordinated way then you have a more efficient way of making money," he added. other than a computer running slower, victims will be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a "bitnet". it is a variation on the traditional botnet, networks of malware-infected computers used to churn out spam or bombard websites with requests in order to knock them offline. some experts estimate that such networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day. since bitcoins have risen in value - at its peak one bitcoin was worth $1,000 - making it a lucrative market for online criminals. "bitcoin mining malware is the new frontier as criminal gangs look for new ways to make money," said mr engel. yahoo acknowledged the attack in a statement earlier this week. "from december 31 to january 3 on our european sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines - specifically, they spread malware," the statement read. it went on to say that users in america, asia and latin america weren't affected but did not specify how many european users were victims. fox it, the dutch cybersecurity firm which revealed the malware attack, estimates that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site. over the period of the attack that could mean as many as two million machines were infected. such attacks may be hard to avoid, said mr shulman. "for an ad platform it is virtually impossible to guarantee 100% malware free ads." "there are many independent stakeholders involved in the process of web advertising, so from time to time any ad platform is bound to deliver malware." with a couple of mouse clicks amateur cyber thieves can quickly create malware that steals cash from smartphones.the growing number of such kits is behind the rapid rise in the number of viruses aimed at owners and users of mobiles.kevin mahaffey, chief technology officer at lookout mobile security, demonstrates how easy it is to create mobile malware. south africa has been hit by one of the biggest cyber-fraud attacks in its history, according to the body that oversees local financial transactions. the payment card systems of thousands of shops, restaurants and hotels had been compromised, said the payment association of south africa (pasa). losses were thought to be in the "tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions of rands", it said. it added the attackers had used a new variant of the malware known as dexter. ten million rand is worth £626,000 or just over $1m. dexter gets its name from a string of code found in one of its files, which may refer to the us television show that followed the exploits of a serial killer. the dexter code was linked to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the uk, us and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year. it skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,. pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in europe, but added it was not sure from which countries. "it's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses," walter volker, pasa's chief executive, told the bbc. "we started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-january, february. we initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company. "eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software." mr volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen pin codes or cvv payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops. "normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got," mr volker added. "it seems like it was a european-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but interpol and europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators." kfc fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the bloomberg news agency. "we take this extremely seriously," yum brands said. "our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal." bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, famous brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed. however, pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack. "in terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way," said mr volker. "the south african card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. it's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts. "if that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank." the uk's data privacy regulator has told organisations under its watch they should "immediately check" if they have been affected by the solarwinds hack. the texas-based company - which provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients - recently disclosed one of its leading products had been compromised. the watchdog reminded those holding data on uk citizens they had 72 hours to report a breach once discovered. officials continue to study the impact. last week, a security source told the bbc that the investigators believed only a small number of british organisations had been affected and none were in the public sector. however, since then it has been reported that the accountants deloitte, chip-makers intel and nvidia, and cloud-computing software maker vmware are all among those who have used the orion network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers a backdoor. there are also indications that the us treasury and departments of homeland security, state, defence and commerce were also targeted via the breach, which has been dubbed "sunburst". us secretary of state mike pompeo and attorney general bill barr have both accused russia of being responsible, as have several cyber-security experts. however, president donald trump has muddied the waters by suggesting china could be behind the attack. both the kremlin and the chinese government have denied involvement. solarwinds published its own guidance to its clients on its website last week, however the whole site now appears to be offline. solarwinds has said that it believes "fewer than 18,000" of its customers had installed the compromised orion updates. bruce schneier, a leading cyber-security researcher, has written in the guardian that "it's hard to overstate how bad this is". it will take years to learn which networks the svr [russian espionage agency] has penetrated, and where it still has access." but he noted that the us national security agency (nsa) was probably running similar offensive operations of its own on the same scale. even so, president-elect joe biden has promised the us will respond in turn, and mentioned suspicions that russia was to blame. "we can't let this go unanswered. that means making clear and publicly who is responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account," he said in a speech on tuesday. mr biden also noted that the department of defense had refused to brief him on "many things" including the attack. uk assessing impact of major hacking campaignrussia behind major cyber-attack, says pompeosolarwinds: why the sunburst hack matters  the uk's national cyber security centre has also urged organisations to take steps to protect their networks. "this is a complex, global cyber-incident," said its director of operations, paul chichester. "but simply having solarwinds does not automatically make an organisation vulnerable to real-world impact." to further complicate matters, microsoft has said its own inquiry into the breach has uncovered a further problem. "in an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole solarwinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the solarwinds orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor," it said in a blog published on friday. it added that that the malicious code provided the perpetrator the means to install and run their own software on a target's machines. microsoft did not speculate as to whom this second attacker might be or how they might have exploited the hack. sophisticated malware aimed at governments and finance firms was probably created by a nation state, say security researchers. mask was uncovered by kaspersky labs and the code is thought to have been targeting victims for seven years. the software is among the "most advanced threats" the company has ever seen, it said in a lengthy analysis. the web-wide activities of mask stopped last week soon after kaspersky revealed its existence. kaspersky said mask had hit targets in 31 countries and infected more than 380 separate organisations and businesses.  it used a variety of techniques to compromise machines and, in some cases, its creators seem to have bought undocumented vulnerabilities in software in order to penetrate some targets.  different versions of mask were prepared by its creators so no matter what operating system people used, be it windows, apple ios or linux, they were vulnerable. kaspersky said it also suspected that versions of mask were available that could attack android or apple smartphones. the software gets its name from the regular appearance of the spanish word for mask (careto) in its core code. other hints in the code suggest it originated in a spanish-speaking nation. kaspersky said it suspected mask was created by a nation state to help it spy but declined to speculate about which country was behind it.  top of the target list were organisations in morocco but institutions and companies in brazil, the uk, france and spain and many other nations were also caught out.  as well as governments and private equity firms, other victims included embassies, oil and gas companies, activist groups and research labs. once it managed to infect a system, the virus stole documents, encryption keys, private network credentials and remote access information.  soon after kaspersky uncovered mask it took action with other computer firms to shut 90 of the command-and-control systems keeping it running.  so far, said symantec security researcher liam o'murchu, it was not clear who was behind mask or what they were after.  "just looking at the targets, it is not obvious who would want to target them; there is no obvious pattern," he told reuters.  "the code is professionally written, but it's even difficult to say whether is it written by a government or by a private company that sells this type of software." some 79% of malicious attacks on mobiles in 2012 occurred on devices running google's android operating system, us authorities have said. public information website public intelligence published the department of homeland security and the federal bureau of investigation memo to us police and emergency medical personnel. nokia's symbian system, on the finnish company's basic-feature handsets, had had the second-most malware attacks. apple's ios had had 0.7% of attacks. android is the world's most popular mobile operating system, and the memo blamed its high share of attacks on its "market share and open-source architecture". text trojans - malware that sends sms messages to premium-rate numbers without the phone owners' knowledge - accounted for half of the android attacks on old versions of the system.  the memo also cited fake sites that appeared to be like google's play marketplace and "rootkits" that allowed hackers to track a user's keystrokes and passwords. it said 44% of android users were still using older versions of the operating system - specifically 2.3.3 through 2.3.7, dubbed gingerbread and released in 2011. these have a "number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions", the memo added.  "the growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile os patched and up-to-date," it said. apple has said that more than 93% of the 600 million iphones and ipads sold run  ios 6, the latest version of the operating system.  the next version is expected to be released to the public next month. this is the not the first time the open nature of google's popular phone software has been questioned.  security firm symantec noted last month that a "master key" bug - which allows attackers to take control of android phones - was being exploited in china.  the bug exploited a vulnerability in all android apps, which contain an encrypted signature that the operating system uses to check the program is legitimate and has not been tampered with. you might think the world's most powerful man would have access to any gadget he chooses - but when it comes consumer tech, joe biden may be sorely disappointed.  the electronic devices around the us president are perhaps the most prominent hacking targets in the world.  "the odds are zero, that [russia] aren't targeting world leaders," harvard kennedy school lecturer bruce schneier says. back in the 2000s, this wasn't such a big problem - the only personal devices that could be hacked were computers and non-smart mobile phones.  and why would the president need a mobile, when he could ask to be patched through to anyone in the world on a secure line. but that all changed in 2009, when barack obama took office.  he was so attached to his blackberry he fought with security advisers for weeks to keep it - a fight he eventually won "through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends", according to an official. and since then, the range of tech devices a president might want to use has steadily increased - giving security advisers sleepless nights.  when the ipad came out, in 2010, of course, the president wanted one.  so national-security advisers created the obamapad, a "hardened", more secure ipad, which, a former adviser tells bbc news, was replicated for his staff. "in the obama administration, for senior staff, it was common to have an ipad that had... certain modifications to it," says ari schwartz, a national security council cyber-security official during the obama administration. nevertheless, the tech set-up of the white house remained somewhat old fashioned. "there's no wi-fi," mr schwartz says. "and we actually had a little bit of a discussion at one point about adding wi-fi. "it was more of a discussion like, 'why can't we have wi-fi in the white house?' "and the feeling was, 'well, then you're opening up security lapses.'"  the obamas' residence eventually installed wi-fi. but it remained patchy at best, according to the family. donald trump, arguably the most famous man on twitter during his term, also insisted on using a personal device, reportedly a series of "burner" phones used briefly and then replaced for security reasons. but he was also widely reported to be sceptical of computer use and email, preferring paper for most communications. if the ipad gave tech advisers a few sleepless nights back in the day, the internet of things, today, represents a recurring nightmare. "everything is becoming a computer," mr schneier says. "and those computers are vulnerable.  "whether it's your peloton bike or your phone, your refrigerator, your thermostat, toys, your car - these are all vulnerable to hacking."  and that is a problem for president biden, who seems to like his gadgets.  he has been photographed wearing an apple watch and reportedly owns a peloton exercise bike that comes with a computer screen, camera, and microphone all connected to the internet.  can that be made secure?  "you can do things like modify the hardware, like ripping the camera out, that's something that the nsa [national security agency] can do," mr schneier says. and that may be safer. but it may also defeat the purpose of having high-end technology in the first place. herbert lin, of the university of stanford, says: "it's very rare that you find a device that can't be hacked. "most devices that can't be hacked are pretty useless because they can't communicate." the safest thing is simply to not use any tech gadgets at all.  but, as the previous two presidents proved, that is a hard thing to tell the commander-in-chief. according to mr biden's biographer evan osnos, the president also uses the apple news app. and this too could be a problem.  in fact, mr schwartz says, software can be hardest to protect. "the software side, it's a lot harder to maintain good security around, because everything is updated from afar now," he says. "you might be totally secure right now, the day that you buy the product.  "but then a year from now, someone could come in and install malware into it and destroy the security that you had originally." and mr schneier shares these concerns. "everything is a potential vulnerability… apple news, everything, because it's all connected, because anything can affect any other thing," he says.  "that's why this is so complicated.  "that's why ditching the device is often the best security advice, even if it's not practical."  late last year, news broke us government networks had been compromised by suspected russian hackers. the massive solar winds hack reportedly affected the treasury and commerce departments and homeland security.   even worse, once the hackers were in, they lay undetected for months.  the hack showed two things:  foreign actors are looking for cracks in us cyber-securitythere are gaps to be found  the nightmare scenario is a president's device is hacked, which then goes unnoticed.  and that a hack has happened so recently - and so close to the white house - will have president biden's security team worried.  "say the president's iphone is hacked," mr lin says.  "now, you have a homing beacon that the president is carrying." mr biden is entering a white house nervous about cyber-security.  and advisers know what is most secure and what the president wants are not usually aligned.  president biden may be the most powerful person in the most powerful country in the world.  but he may also have a fight on his hands to keep the gadgets many others take for granted. james clayton is the bbc's north america technology reporter based in san francisco. follow him on twitter @jamesclayton5. samsung has signed a deal with an anti-virus firm to offer improved protection to its galaxy-branded android devices. it will use san francisco-based lookout's software to scan handsets and tablets for threats. the feature will be targeted at business users as part of the firm's forthcoming knox security product, which was announced in february. numerous studies have indicated that many hackers have focused their efforts on google's android system. analysts said the move was designed to reassure companies that samsung's android phones were a safe alternative to the blackberry and windows phone platforms which have promoted their enterprise security facilities as key features. lookout's chief executive blogged that malware protection had become increasingly important at a time more employees were linking their own devices to office networks. "one in three companies now allow employees to bring their own devices to work, and whether or not it's allowed, employees are doing so and company data is being accessed outside of the corporate network, potentially putting that data at risk," wrote john hering. the company said its servers would scan samsung's mobile devices against known malware that could be introduced via email attachments, webpages or file-sharing services. other anti-virus firms have also been quick to play up the threat to android devices. kaspersky recently announced that it had detected 57,000 new examples of malware specifically targeting the operating system since the start of the year.  mcafee has also warned that new types of spyware and code designed to bypass bank id protection had helped swell the amount of android malware by 35% in the april-to-june quarter. the us government has also issued its own alert suggesting 79% of all malware threats to mobile operating systems were directed at android in 2012. "android is the most insecure mobile system of all the mobile ones, and that's been made more difficult because it's so fragmented," said richard absalom, an analyst at telecoms consultancy ovum. "it's not just that that people are still running old versions of the software, but that samsung and other vendors are forking the os in different ways." google itself has taken steps to address the problem. earlier this month it banned apps from its play store that make changes to a device without the owner's knowledge or consent. but one expert suggested the firm had still not gone far enough. "new variants of android malware are found every day, with most designed to steal money from users by signing them up for expensive premium rate sms scams," independent security analyst graham cluley told the bbc. "much of the android malware has disguised itself as fake versions of popular apps like angry birds or instagram, and although its normally encountered in unofficial app stores they have also managed to intrude into google's official play store on a worrying number of occasions." samsung began offering its knox product to selected galaxy s4 handsets in may and has promised it would be extended to other devices. the pentagon is among organisations to have authorised the use of handsets which include the feature. "this approval enables other government agencies and regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services to adopt samsung galaxy smartphones and tablets," the south korean firm said at the time. ovum suggested the latest announcement would help give the company an edge over other android manufacturers such as sony, htc and lg. "what samsung is doing here is seeing a gap in the market," said mr absalom. "blackberry's share within enterprise is dropping and windows phone isn't picking up as fast as microsoft might have hoped.  "samsung is the biggest individual smartphone manufacturer out there and it thinks it can now make a major play in the corporate market." a service accused of helping distribute child abuse images on a hidden part of the internet has been compromised. sites using service provider freedom hosting to deliver their material have had code added to their pages, which could be used to reveal the identities of people visiting them. freedom hosting delivered sites via tor, a network designed to keep net activity anonymous. the news has led some to claim that tor no longer offers a "safe option". "this challenges the assumption people have made that tor is a simple way of maintaining your anonymity online," alan woodward, chief technology officer at security advisors charteris, told the bbc. "the bottom line is that is not guaranteed even if you think you are taking the right steps to hide your identity. this is the first time we've seen somebody looking to unmask people rather than just security researchers discussing the possibility." mr woodward added that the way the added code had been designed suggested a us law enforcement agency was behind the breach. tor users expressed mixed feelings about the news. "this exploit targets kiddie porn viewers only. if that's not you, you have nothing to worry about," suggested one. an "exploit" refers to software that makes programs, websites and other code do something they were not originally designed to do. but another said: "this week it's child porn, next week it may be a whistle-blower or an activist." news of the action was confirmed by an administrator of the tor project on its blog.  it said that over the weekend people had contacted it to say that a large number of sites using tor, which were hidden from other net users, had gone offline simultaneously. "the current news indicates that someone has exploited the software behind freedom hosting," it said. "from what is known so far, the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of javascript exploit in the web pages delivered to users. this exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect users' computers." freedom hosting was previously targeted by the anonymous hacktivist collective, whose members temporarily forced it offline in 2011 after claiming it was the largest host of material showing child abuse on tor. the daily dot news site reports that paedophiles continued to use the hosting service and have been warning each other of the breach since the news emerged. they also told each other to stop using tormail, a service used to allow people to send and receive email anonymously, which used freedom hosting's servers. freedom hosting also provided access to hackbb, a hacking-themed discussion forum, and the cleaned hidden wiki, an encyclopaedia of tor and other dark nets. the hosting service's terms and conditions had stated that illegal activities were not allowed on the sites it supported, but added that it was "not responsible" for its users' actions. tor's developers have stressed that "the person, or persons, who run freedom hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to the tor project". analysis of the javascript exploit suggests that it takes advantage of a vulnerability in firefox 17, which meant that people using that version of mozilla's browser could be identified, despite the protections built into tor. "it appears to connect the machine using the compromised browser to an address which appears to originate from reston, virginia, us, and sends the hostname and mac [media access control] address of the machine," mr woodward said. "unlike ip [internet protocol] addresses, media access control addresses are considered unique to a particular piece of hardware, although they can be spoofed under certain circumstances. "it seems unlikely that the malware was written by criminals as the information it is sending back to its masters is of little use to anyone other than law enforcement agencies who are trying to track down machines that are using the tor network to remain anonymous." news of the breach came shortly after the irish times reported that a 28-year-old dublin-based man had been arrested and accused by the fbi of being "the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet". it said that eric eoin marques faces allegations that he had aided and abetted a conspiracy to advertise material showing the abuse of prepubescent children. the paper reported that the us authorities are seeking his extradition on four charges.  it said the judge in the case ruled that while mr marques was entitled to the presumption of innocence, he should remain in custody pending a further hearing because he posed a flight risk. a spokesman for the fbi told the bbc: "an individual has been arrested in ireland as part of an ongoing criminal investigation in the united states. because this is matter is ongoing, longstanding department of justice policy prohibits us from discussing this matter further." hackers who wiped tens of thousands of pc hard drives in south korea earlier this year also appear to be targeting the country's military secrets, according to a report. a study by mcafee labs said the group has created malware which scanned systems for keywords including "weapon", "us army" and "secret". it said that once a computer's contents had been catalogued, the attackers could "grab documents at will". south korea has played down the threat. its defence ministry told the associated press news agency that it was technically impossible to have lost classified reports because the computers on which it stored military secrets were not connected to the net. a spokesman for the pentagon said it planned to review the report. mcafee said the attacks were part of a long-term spying operation dating back to at least 2009 which it called operation troy because the name of the ancient city repeatedly appeared in the hackers' code. it began investigating the group following an attack in march which caused data held on pcs used by several banks and tv networks to be deleted. although the security firm said that the malware used to wipe the disks was distinct from that used to hunt for the military secrets, it said there were so many similarities between the two that it believed they must be created by the same team. it traced the spying effort back to at least 2009 when it said the hackers managed to place an exploit on a military social networking site. it added that it believed the code was also spread through the use of "spear phishing" - email or other messages masquerading as official communications which were designed to fool specific individuals into handing over logins and other sensitive information. the report said that once the malware was in place it searched the infected systems for "interesting" documents.  to do this it scanned for a variety of korean and english-language keywords.  the study lists dozens of examples including "tactics", "brigade", "logistics" and "operation key resolve" - a military exercise involving both south korean and us forces carried out every year. mcafee said it had opted to withhold other "sensitive" terms at the request of us officials. the report explained the software then flagged which computers appeared to have the most valuable contents and uploaded copies of their directories to the attackers' servers. it said the hackers were then able to pick and choose which files to download in order to keep network traffic to a minimum, helping them avoid detection.  mcafee also warned that it had discovered a version of the spying malware which had the ability to destroy data in a way similar to the one used against the civilian targets. "this capability could be devastating if military networks were to suddenly be wiped after an adversary had gathered intelligence," it said. "there was at least one limitation, however. we found the malware of february 2011 could wipe its targets only if it was detected that it was being debugged or analysed by a security product." a spokesman for south korea's government denied classified documents would have been at risk since the computer network that stored them was not connected to the net. "it's physically separated," said kim min-seok. however, one of the report's authors suggested there was still a risk. "it is not entirely impossible to extract information from a closed network that is disconnected from the internet," said senior threat researcher ryan sherstobitoff. "[but] it would require some extensive planning and understanding of the internal layout to stage such an exfiltration [unauthorised data transfer] to the external world." the report does not name who mcafee believes to be responsible, however south korean officials have previously said that the 20 march attack "resembled north korea's past hacking patterns". the creators of the flame malware have sent a "suicide" command that removes it from some infected computers. security firm symantec caught the command using booby-trapped computers set up to watch flame's actions. flame came to light after the un's telecoms body asked for help with identifying a virus found stealing data from many pcs in the middle east. new analysis of flame reveals how sophisticated the program is and gives hints about who created it. like many other security firms symantec has kept an eye on flame using so-called "honeypot" computers that report what happens when they are infected with a malicious program. described as a very sophisticated cyber-attack, flame targeted countries such as iran and israel and sought to steal large amounts of sensitive data. earlier this week symantec noticed that some flame command and control (c&c) computers sent an urgent command to the infected pcs they were overseeing. flame's creators do not have access to all their c&c computers as security firms have won control of some of them. the "suicide" command was "designed to completely remove flame from the compromised computer", said symantec. the command located every flame file sitting on a pc, removed it and then overwrote memory locations with gibberish to thwart forensic examination. "it tries to leave no traces of the infection behind,"  
          
 
          wrote the firm on its blog. analysis of the clean-up routine suggested it was written in early may, said symantec.  at the same time, analysis of the inner workings of flame reveal just how sophisticated it is. according to cryptographic experts, flame is the first malicious program to use an obscure cryptographic technique known as "prefix collision attack". this allowed the virus to fake digital credentials that had helped it to spread. the exact method of carrying out such an attack was only demonstrated in 2008 and the creators of flame came up with their own variant. "the design of this new variant required world-class cryptanalysis," said cryptoexpert marc stevens from the centrum wiskunde & informatica (cwi) in amsterdam  
          
 
          in a statement
.
         the finding gives support to claims that flame must have been built by a nation state rather than cybercriminals because of the amount of time, effort and resources that must have been put into its creation. it is not yet clear which nation created the program.
