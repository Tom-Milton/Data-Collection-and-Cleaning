targeted threats are a class of malware destined for one specific organization or industry.  a type of crimeware, these threats are of particular concern because they are designed to capture sensitive information.  targeted attacks may include threats delivered via smtp e-mail, port attacks, zero day attack vulnerability exploits or phishing messages.  government organisations are the most targeted sector.[1]  financial industries are the second most targeted sector, most likely because cybercriminals desire to profit from the confidential, sensitive information the financial industry it infrastructure houses.[2] similarly, online brokerage accounts have also been targeted by such attacks.[3]
 the impact of targeted attacks can be far-reaching.  in addition to regulatory sanctions imposed by hipaa, sarbanes-oxley, the gramm-leach-bliley act and other laws, they can lead to the loss of revenue, focus and corporate momentum.  they not only expose sensitive customer data, but damage corporate reputations and incur potential lawsuits.[4]
 in contrast to a widespread spam attack, which are widely noticed, because targeted attacks are only sent to a limited number of organizations, these crimeware threats tend to not be reported and thus elude malware scanners.[5]
